The police command in Akwa Ibom says it has arrested 15 persons over the alleged destruction of banks in Oron LGA of the state. Odiko Maldon, police public relations officer, spoke to journalists in Oron, on Sunday. About three banks were reportedly attacked during protests that broke out across the state on Friday. On Thursday, some persons were injured in a stampede that occurred at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) office in Uyo when anti-riot police officers tried to disperse the crowd that besieged the premises. The residents had gone to the CBN to deposit their old naira notes. “We received information that some banks were attacked in Oron local government and the police immediately swung into action,” Maldon said. “As we speak, about 15 persons have been arrested in connection with the incident. “The commissioner of police, Mr Olatoye Durosinmi expressed sadness about the situation and directed divisional police officers in the affected local governments to ensure that there is no further breakdown of law and order.” The police spokesperson added that the commissioner urged residents to be law abiding as anyone caught vandalising public property would be dealt with decisively. He said the police would do everything possible to ensure that Akwa Ibom remains one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria.
