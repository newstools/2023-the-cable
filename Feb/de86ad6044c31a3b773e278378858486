Duro Meseko, chief executive officer of Dgovscoops Communications Ltd, has expressed his delight over the approval of a licence to operate a radio station in the country. In a statement on Saturday, the former member of the house of representatives described the achievement as a dream come true. Meseko said it had been his desire to establish a “world standard” radio and TV station in Kogi where he hails from, adding that the opportunity to render public service would not be taken for granted. “The entire staff and management of Dgovscoops Communications Ltd just received the good news of the radio licence granted us. It is indeed a dream come true for us,” the veteran journalist said. “We are grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) for finding us fit for the task ahead. We shall not disappoint in the discharge of our patriotic duties. “It’s a new broadcast dawn for Kogi state and everyone is excited.” Meseko’s statement comes days after Balarabe Ilelah, director-general of the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), announced that the federal government recently granted 67 new broadcast licences. Giving highlights of the commission’s achievements at a media briefing on Thursday, Ilelah added that there are now a total number of 740 functional broadcast stations in Nigeria. Meanwhile, Meseko had, in May 2020, launched a news blog — dgovscoops.ng.
