Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the APC, was in Kano on January 4 for a north-west rally. On Thursday, President Muhammadu Buhari was present as Tinubu took his campaign to Sokoto. Speaking at a meeting with Muhammad Abubakar, the sultan of Sokoto, Buhari said Tinubu would perform well as president “because he understands Nigeria”. “My wish is for your support and blessings. We want to win,” the president had said. “He [Tinubu] understands Nigeria very well and he is ever supportive of people wherever they may have come from in Nigeria. “I have gone with him to Nasarawa and Katsina and I am here with him today. I will also go with him to any other place. He is the candidate of our party. “He emerged from a clearly transparent primary election. We, therefore, have to follow him as the flagbearer of the party.”
