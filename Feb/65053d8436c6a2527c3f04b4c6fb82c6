The Texas board of nursing has filed charges against some nurses for allegedly obtaining educational credentials fraudulently in the United States. In a multi-state coordinated law enforcement action, called Operation Nightingale, the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), discovered that some individuals had obtained fraudulent nursing degree diplomas and transcripts. The investigation, which was launched on January 25, was aimed at uncovering fraudulent dealings where individuals acquired nursing credentials and used them to qualify to sit for the national nursing board examination. “Upon successful completion of the board exam, the nursing applicants became eligible to obtain licensure in various states to work as an RN or a LPN/VN,” the board said. “The board is working, diligently, with all appropriate nursing regulatory bodies, nursing education program providers, accreditation bodies and authorities to detect, investigate and resolve these matters as quickly as possible, including seeking revocation of any licensure obtained through fraudulent means. “The board will continue to provide more information as it becomes publicly available.” The board, meanwhile, named about 20 nurses of Nigerian descent, who were said to be involved in the fraudulent scheme. Those indicted are Abanda, Jacob Atambili, (LVN #1054553); Abiodun, Yetunde Felicia, (LVN #1043387); Addai, Agnes Fosuah, (RN #941850); Adelakun, Abiodun Aveez, (RN #1034998); Adelekan, Joseph Adewale, (LVN #351002); Adeoye, Vivien Temitope, (LVN #342620); Adewale, Modinat Abidemi, (LVN#353512); Afolabi, Olufemi Toun, (LVN#1009094); Afolabi, Omowunmi F, (LVN #1016030); Agbo, Odumegwu Steve, (RN #882398); Ajibade, Charlot Omotayo,( LVN #351402); Akande, Olabisi Christiana, (LVN #1055270).

The board is authorised to file formal charges against a nurse if probable cause exists that the nurse has committed an act listed in Tex. Occ. Code §301.452(b) or that violates other law. See Tex. Occ. Code §301.458,” the board added. “Further, formal charges are publicly available. See Tex. Occ. Code §301.466(b). Please note that formal charges are not a final disciplinary action, and a nurse is permitted to work, as a nurse, while formal charges are pending. This list will be updated continuously as the board receives additional information about the fraudulent diploma/transcript scheme.”
