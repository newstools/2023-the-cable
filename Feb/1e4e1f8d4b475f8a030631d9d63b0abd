Bolaji Abdullahi, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Kwara central senatorial district, has disputed the result of the national assembly election which declared his defeat. The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared Salihu Mustapha, the All Progressive Congress (APC) candidate, winner of the Kwara central senatorial district election. Mustapha secured a total of 109,823 votes to defeat Abdullahi, who polled 69,202 votes. In a statement by his media team on Monday, Abdullahi said the preliminary review of the results showed “substantial irregularities and manipulations” that are inconsistent with the provisions of the electoral law. The former minister urged PDP members and supporters to remain calm, saying a team of lawyers is already studying the results and would take appropriate legal steps. “While the party explores the instruments of the law to prosecute its grievances, I appeal for calm across the district and urge our supporters to remain law-abiding,” Abdullahi said.
