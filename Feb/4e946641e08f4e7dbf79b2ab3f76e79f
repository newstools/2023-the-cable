Gunmen have set ablaze the country home of Nnaemeka Obiaraeri, the Imo assembly LP candidate representing Okigwe LGA. Obiaraeri in a statement said the incident occurred in the early hours of Saturday. He said the gunmen stormed his house in Amagu Ihube with three Toyota Hilux vehicles and burnt it to ashes, adding that his cars and houses belonging to his father and uncle were destroyed. “Just got another share of the terrible state of security in Nigeria. Unknown gunmen came to my country home in Amagu Ihube, and burnt to ashes the operational factory vehicles including my house,” Obiaraeri said. “They also destroyed my father’s house and that of my uncle. My aged mum and siblings are currently in trauma. “The insecurity in our state has gotten to its precipice. I don’t know who I offended and why anybody could target me for destruction. I have not eaten anyone’s yam or fish. “This again reinforces our call for Nigerians to pick their PVCs and help vote for Peter Obi and Ahmed Datti of the Labour Party, the next President and the next Vice President of the country. “APC government has failed us woefully especially in terms of protecting lives and property.”
