Residents of Sagamu, Ogun state, have taken to the streets to protest the scarcity of naira notes. TheCable understands that protesters burnt tyres along major roads in the city on Monday morning. Pictures and videos shared on social media show the protesters attacking some banks in the community. Confirming the incident to TheCable, Abimbola Oyeyemi, the state’s police spokesperson, said the protesters have become belligerent and were attacking officers deployed to restore normalcy. “We are there right now. We are there already and the protesters are attacking us,” Oyeyemi said. The protesters were said to have attacked three banks–Union Bank, First Bank, and Keystone Bank branches. The latest protest continues the trend of demonstrations fuelled by the scarcity of naira notes following the federal government’s redesign of N200, N500, and N1000. On Friday, several road blockages were mounted by the protesters in Ifo LGA of the state with commercial activities affected. On February 7, one person was shot as another set of protesters vandalised banks in the Abeokuta area of the state. There have also been protests nationwide as the cash crunch bites Nigerians harder.
