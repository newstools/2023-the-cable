The Lagos State Park Management Agency (LSPMA) says its members were not responsible for the protest that took place in the state over the naira scarcity. On Friday, protests broke out in Lagos, Rivers, Ogun, Ondo, and Oyo states. In Lagos, residents were stranded as protesters took over the Ojota area of the state before spreading to Maryland, Ketu, Mile 12, and some parts of Ikorodu. Adekunle Matiminu, chairman of Mile-12 branch of the agency, said some hoodlums were responsible for the disruptions that happened in the area. Matiminu said none of the agency’s member was involved in the protest, adding that they assisted the police to disperse the protesting hoodlums. “We, staff members of the Lagos State Park Management Agency, Mile-12, don’t want any trouble in this area. We want peace,” he said. “The people protesting are ‘Area Boys’. They are not our members. They are the ones burning tyres around. But we chased them out of this place. “If they want money, they know where to go and get money, not to cause trouble here. “We will not allow them. You can see now the place is peaceful. We have many police officers around too.” Commenting on the incident, Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police public relations officers, said the situation has been de-escalated. “Although we don’t know those involved in the protest, normalcy has returned to the area with the deployment of more operatives,” Hundeyin said. “Free movement of vehicles and people fully restored. Our officers and men are still on ground to prevent any breakdown of law and order. If you see something, say something. “It is true our men are there. Reinforcement units have been deployed. I enjoin members of the public to stay safe as we closely monitor and manage the situation.”
