The Anambra police command says its operatives thwarted an attack on the divisional headquarters in Ogidi, Idemili north LGA of the state. In a statement shared with TheCable, Ikenga Tochukwu, police spokesperson in Anambra, said the armed men attacked the station early Monday morning. The police spokesperson said officers on duty engaged the attackers in a firefight and overpowered them, adding that one of the gunmen was killed. “Today 13/2/2023 by 2:15 am, Police Operatives foiled an attack by armed men on the Ogidi Police station, demobilise one of the armed men,” the statement reads. “The hoodlums/arsonists came in their numbers with an unmarked Toyota Hiace bus, a Toyota Hilux and three motorcycles, started shooting indiscriminately and attempted to gain access in Ogidi Police Station, Idemili North. “They were fiercely resisted by Police Officers on duty and due to the superior gunfire of the operatives, the hoodlums fled the scene while one of the armed men was neutralized by the operatives.” Tochukwu said cartridges and 25 litres of premium motor spirit (PMS) were recovered from the gunmen. He said the police facility is intact and no casualty was recorded on the side of the police. “The area has been reinforced by the tactical teams of the command, and police operation is still ongoing,” he added. The development is the latest in a series of attacks on police facilities in the south-east state. In January, suspected hoodlums set ablaze the Umuchu police station in Aguata LGA of Anambra state. The facility, destroyed during the #EndSARS protest in 2020, was undergoing renovation when it was set on fire.
