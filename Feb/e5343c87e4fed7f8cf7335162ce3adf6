A faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) led by Shehu Sagagi has defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Sunusi Tofa, spokesperson of the NNPP campaign council, announced the development in a statement on Sunday. The defectors were received into the NNPP by Rufai Alkali, national chairman of the party, and Isaac Idahosa, vice-presidential candidate of the party at a ceremony held in Kano. NAN quoted Sagagi as saying that he and others left the PDP due to the lack of internal democracy and nepotism by the national leadership of the party. Sagagi said he alongside 36 state executive members, over 700 local government executives, 8,000 ward executives, 44 national delegates, and 1452 ward delegates were happy to return to the PDP. “Politics is a game of numbers, we are optimistic that the NNPP Presidential Candidate, Sen. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso will take us to victory at both national and state level,” he was quoted as saying. “The PDP sabotaged itself in states like Kano by allowing the likes of Sen. Kwankwaso to defect in spite of his massive followership not only in the state but the nation at large. “To us this is a homecoming, we are real politicians and we have joined a political party that plays real politics. I am happy to rejoin Sen. Kwankwaso once again a year after our departure.” In his remarks, Rufai Alkali, national chairman of the NNPP, congratulated the defectors for their “wise decision” of joining the NNPP.
