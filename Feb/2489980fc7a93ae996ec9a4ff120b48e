Ned Nwoko, businessman and former lawmaker, has been declared winner of election in Delta north senatorial district. Announcing the result in Oshimili south LGA on Monday, Josephine Okeakwa, returning officer of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), said Nwoko polled 92,514 votes from the nine LGAs of Delta north to defeat his closest rival, Kennedy Kamma of the Labour Party (LP) who polled 86,121 votes. Peter Nwaoboshi, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress(APC) who is currently in prison following his conviction for fraud, came third with 36,816 votes. Nwoko won in Aniocha north, Ika north east, Ndokwa east, Ndokwa west, and Ukwuani LGAs, while the LP won in Aniocha south, Ika south, Oshimili north, and Oshimili south. In 2019, the supreme court sacked Nwoko and affirmed Nwaoboshi as the senator representing Delta north district.
