Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says his administration will apologise to victims of police brutality if elected. Speaking on Saturday during a rally in Lagos, Obi said his administration will ensure that security operatives do not harass Nigerians. The rally took place at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) in Onikan, Lagos. The LP presidential candidate promised that his administration will recruit, train, and equip police officers on effective policing. He also promised that his administration will guarantee freedom of the press. “When you vote for us, I assure you that there will be freedom of press so the press can criticise what we are doing,” he said. “Our security people would no longer be for harassment. Police will not harass anybody. “We are going to recruit. We are going to train them on how to do policing and equip them. Police will be a friend, not enemy. “They are going to do the work of policing. We will not have all these problems that we have. “We will apologise to all those who are victims of police brutality. All those who had suffered in the hands of the government, we will apologise to them. We will make sure it never happens again.” Speaking further, the former Anambra governor said it is time for persons who are born after the country gained independence to rule the country. He asked the electorate not to vote for those who were born before the country gained independence.
