Twitter, US-based microblogging and social networking platform, says it will share revenue from adverts with content creators on the platform. Elon Musk, Twitter’s chief executive officer, said the revenue will be shared only with creators whose posts receive adverts in their reply threads. However, in a tweet on Friday, the billionaire noted that only the content creators who are subscribers to Twitter blue verified will benefit from the gesture. Twitter Blue represents account holders who pay $8 monthly subscription. “Starting today, Twitter will share ad revenue with creators for ads that appear in their reply threads,” Musk tweeted. “To be eligible, the account must be a subscriber to Twitter blue verified.” When the subscription was introduced last year, Musk had said subscribers to service would get priority in replies, mentions, and searches, which he said was “essential to defeat” spam accounts. He added that users will also see half as many adverts and will be able to post long video and audio clips. Meanwhile, in November last year, Musk said existing verified account holders will lose their blue checkmarks “in a few months” unless they pay $8 monthly.
