Josiah Godwin, a 20-year-old apprentice, has allegedly killed Savior Joseph, his boss. Godwin allegedly dumped Joseph’s corpse in a well at Imafon Community in Akure south LGA of Ondo state. Trouble started when the deceased, who specialised in fixing POP asbestos, allegedly smashed the apprentice’s phone over an unsettled dispute. Odey Julius, the elder brother of the deceased, said Joseph’s body was found four days ago in a well at the site where Godwin and his boss went to work at Imafon community. “Last week Tuesday, the deceased spoke with me in the morning but when I tried his telephone number on Wednesday, it didn’t get through,” he said. “And I thought he had a flat battery. But it was on Saturday that I was called by another younger brother of mine who also complained of not being able to reach the deceased on his telephone line. “Afterwards, we contacted the apprentice of the deceased and asked him about the whereabouts of his master. He said his boss woke him up at night, collected his phone, and smashed it on the floor. He said the deceased began to beat him and later asked him to sleep. “The apprentice said that he decided to leave the site the following day.” Julius said when he queried Godwin on why he had to leave the site without seeing his boss, the apprentice claimed that he thought his master went to the toilet. “But when we checked the phone he said was smashed on the floor by the deceased, there was no scratch on it,” Julius said. Ogar Julius, an in-law to the deceased, said the suspect has been arrested and transferred to the Police Criminal Investigative Department (CID), at the police headquarters in Akure. Funmilayo Odunlami-Omisayan, police public relations officer(PPRO) in Ondo, confirmed the incident. Odunlami-Omisayan said the suspect has been apprehended and would be charged in court after investigations.
