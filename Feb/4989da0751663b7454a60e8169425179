Manchester United came from two goals down to claim a 2-2 draw against Leeds United in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Old Trafford on Wednesday night. Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho both scored in the second half to cancel Wilfried Gnoto’s strike and a Raphael Varane own goal. Gnoto gave Leeds the lead barely 56 seconds after a poor start from Man United. The Italian youngster hit a superb low shot from distance. The visitors, who remain without a manager following the sack of Jesse Marsch, doubled their lead early in the second half with Varane diverting a Leeds cross into the net. A double change from Erik ten Hag, Man United manager, sparked a revival as Rashford headed Diogo Dalot’s cross into the far corner on 62 minutes for his 20th goal of the season in all competitions. Sancho, in his first league match since October, levelled the match with a shot that evaded both Leeds defenders and goalkeeper for 2-2. Leeds held on for the point and move one place up to 17th position on the EPL table. The draw means the Red Devils missed the chance to draw level with second-placed Man City on the EPL log, with 43 points from 22 matches, putting them two points behind their crosstown rivals.
