David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi, says he trusts in divine intervention regarding the victory of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking with reporters on Monday while inspecting the ongoing work at the site of the Ebonyi international airport in Onueke, Umahi said with the forthcoming polls, if it is God’s will, Tinubu will win the election. “I don’t know what God wants to do with him but he is set to answer the prayers of his people,” NAN quoted him as saying. “God is set to descend in His majesty on Nigeria because enough is enough.” The governor also dismissed speculations that internal crisis in the party will affect the APC’s chances in the general election. “In every big house, there are vessels of honour and dishonour and all of them work to the glory of God,” he said. “When there are no small squabbles, how do we tell the stories of our triumph? God has set His table before those who want to destroy us so that his glory will be magnified. “I watched the APC rally in Borno and have never seen such a crowd.” Umahi also said citizens should not be worried about the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC because God is for all religions. “We have a Christian-Christian ticket in Ebonyi and in other places you have Muslim-Christian, Christian-Muslim tickets, among others,” he said. “It is not the ticket that matters but the performance. The contention on the same-faith ticket was just a way to deceive the people.”
