Gusau, who was represented at the occasion by Sanusi Mohammed, NFF general secretary, described the officials as “Nigeria’s ambassadors” who should consider the image of the country when called upon to discharge their duties. “They must ensure they do their jobs according to the laid down rules and represent Nigeria well because to whom much is given much is expected,” the NFF president said. “We cannot afford not to have the best team representing us at continental championships. “So, what we want is for the referees to be fair in the discharge of their responsibilities.” Full list of badged referees: FIFA referees: Ogabor Joseph; Nurudeen Abubakr; Quadri Adebimpe; Kassim Abdulsalam; Abdullahi Abubakar; Bashir Salihu; Grema Mohammed FIFA assistant referees: Samuel Pwadutakam; Usman Abdulmajeed; Efosa Igudia Celestine; Hope Igho; Tejiri Digbori; Muhammed Yakubu; Tijjani Ahmad FIFA beach soccer referees: Jelili Ogunmuyiwa; Fawole Olawale; Olayinka Olajide; Rabiu Ahmad FIFA Futsal referees: Bello Zuru Alhassan; Musa Dung Davou; Paul Umuago; Uhah Ndubuisi FIFA women referees: Ndidi Patience; Hannah Eliagwu; Olufunmilayo Alaba; Yemisi Akintoye FIFA women assistant referees: Mfon Friday Akpan; Beauty Kabenda Terah; Abibat Yusuf.
