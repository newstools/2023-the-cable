The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign council has explained why the rally in Rivers was suspended. On Monday, the party cancelled the planned campaign rally which was scheduled to hold on Tuesday. Lee Maeba, chairperson of the campaign council in Rivers who announced the cancellation of the rally, cited attacks on the members of the team in the state. Briefing journalists in Sokoto on Tuesday, Yusuf Dingyadi, a member of the media advisory committee of the PDP campaign, said the decision was taken following the recommendation of the Rivers local organising committee. Dingyadi said the party prioritised public safety over campaign rallies. He said if the campaign had been held, Atiku Abubakar, the party’s standard-bearer, and other party chieftains may be safe due to the protection by “armed security” officers but party supporters may not be safe. “We value our supporters’ lives and their safety more than a campaign show,” Dingyadi said. “Therefore, the PCC agreed with the recommendation of the state’s local organising committee to postpone the rally.” Dingyadi added that the rally will be held when it is safe to do so. “The rally has been shifted till when things are done rightly or till we can continue with the grassroots mobilisation through other efforts.”
