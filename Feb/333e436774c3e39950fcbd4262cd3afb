The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says elections will be held in nine polling units at Ganaja village in Ajaokuta LGA of Kogi state on Sunday. Haliru Sule, head of voter education and publicity in Kogi, told NAN that the exercise became necessary because elections couldn’t hold in the polling units due to some logistics problems. He said election materials and the officials have already been redeployed to the area. “We had some challenges holding the presidential and National Assembly elections in Ganaja village in Ajaokuta local government on Saturday because of some logistic problems,” he was quoted as saying. “We tried to see how it could hold the previous day but we couldn’t, so we have to shift it to Sunday. “The state resident electoral commissioner (REC), Dr Hale Longpet, has given the go-ahead for the election to hold this Sunday, Feb. 26. “We don’t want a situation where some people will be disenfranchised in this very important election.” Sule called on the people of Ganaja to come out en masse to take part in the election. VOTING ALSO EXPECTED IN CROSS RIVER The electoral body has also extended voting in the presidential and national assembly elections in Cross River to Sunday. Anthonia Nwobi, head of voter education and publicity in the state, said elections could not take place in some areas on Saturday. “The extension to Sunday was for the exercise to hold in polling units and wards in Cross River that election did not take place, including Bakassi Local Government Area, Dayspring 1 and 2 as well as Qua Island,” NAN quoted her as saying. “Voting in the affected areas will resume by 8 am and end at noon. “All stakeholders, including members of political parties, Interagency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES), Observers, the press, INEC staff and ad-hoc personnel for the 2023 general elections should be guided.” She said all eligible voters will not be disenfranchised in the 2023 general election.
