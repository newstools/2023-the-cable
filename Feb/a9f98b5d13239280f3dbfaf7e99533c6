Ibikunle Amosun, the lawmaker representing Ogun central senatorial district on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Wednesday, attended the governorship campaign rally of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in the state. The campaign flag-off held at the Ake palace square. Amosun, former governor of Ogun, has publicly campaigned for Biyi Otegbeye, the ADC governorship candidate in the state. Speaking at the event, the lawmaker said his decision to support ADC is because he wants someone who can continue his “considerable achievements” in the state. He decried the policies of governor Dapo Abiodun, current governor of Ogun and member of the APC, adding that the latter deviated from the path of good governance. The ADC campaign also visited Adedotun Gbadebo, the Alake of Egbaland. Amosun’s position is similar to a stance he took in 2019 when he supported Adekunle Akinlade of the Allied Peoples’ Movement (APM) after the latter failed to secure the governorship ticket of the APC. The former governor was later suspended by the APC over “anti-party activities” — but he was pardoned months later. Meanwhile, in October 2022, Amosun had said he would support the APC for the presidential election, while the ADC would have his backing for the Ogun governorship poll.
