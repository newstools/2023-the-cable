The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) says it is working with the body of banks chief executive officers (CEOs) to address the security challenges caused by the ongoing naira scarcity. Yesterday, bank workers union directed members to stay away from work in any state where their branches are attacked. The directive followed a nationwide attack on banks and staff members by angry protesters due to the cash crunch. Ken Okpara, president and chairman of CIBN, in a statement on Friday, said the “safety and security of staff of banks is of paramount importance.” He said the banks would only continue to remain open to serve the public as long as it is safe to do so. “Where there is a security challenge, the management of banks have been empowered to take proactive measures to close operations in such locations and inform the Central Bank of Nigeria,” he said. “Therefore, the safety concerns being expressed in various quarters are already being addressed. Banks will continue to ensure that adequate security are in place to protect staff and customers whilst safeguarding the assets of the banks in contending with the current challenge. “Consequently, we appeal to the general public to remain calm and eschew any act of violence as the banking industry remains resolute and committed to finding ways to address all the related issues. “We indeed appreciate you for your continued patience and understanding as we work together towards restoring normalcy.”
