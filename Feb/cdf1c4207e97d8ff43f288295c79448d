The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) in Imo has asked the state government to engage non-state actors in a dialogue to address the insecurity in the state. Ugochukwu Allinor, chairman of NBA in Imo, gave the advice on Tuesday in Owerri, the Imo capital when members of the association staged a protest against the growing insecurity. The protest came in the wake of the killing of Nnaemeka Ugboma, a judge and the chairman of the customary court in Ejemekwuru, Oguta LGA of the state. The judge was shot dead when gunmen invaded the court during proceedings. The south-east state has been frequently targeted by gunmen in recent times. Allinor said the government must engage the non-state actors to ensure peace is restored. “The rising level of killing in Imo state has assumed a worrisome point,” he said. “We are understandably worried about the attacks, killings, and insecurity in the state, especially the recent gruesome murder of Nnaemeka Ugboma, the chairman of Ejemekwuru customary court, and various other extra-judicial killings going on in Imo state. “The branches of NBA in Imo state, therefore call for the urgent beefing of security around all the courts in Imo state and the judicial officers that are manning these courts. “Similarly, we call on the government of Imo state to urgently devise a dialogue with the non-state actors towards addressing the situation. “Again, NBA Imo state further calls on the government to take more proactive actions toward safeguarding the lives of Imo citizens, especially the judges, magistrates, customary courts chairmen and inspector of courts, staff of the judiciary, and members of the branches of NBA in Imo state.“ The lawyers had said they would boycott all courts in the state starting from Monday, February 6, 2023, through Wednesday, February 8, 2023, due to the gruesome killing of the judge.
