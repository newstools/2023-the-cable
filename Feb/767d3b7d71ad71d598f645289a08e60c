The police command in Lagos says a claim that Igbo traders were attacked and robbed in the Lagos island market is “fake news”. Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, on his verified Twitter handle debunked the report on Monday. The report on social media claimed that thugs of the All Progressives  Party (APC) attacked and robbed people in the market. “APC thugs are on the rampage on the streets of Lagos because Peter Obi won Tinubu. In Abibu Oki street off Broadstreet in Mandilas market Lagos island, they are chasing the Igbos, robbing them and destroying properties,” the report claimed. Debunking the unverified post, Hundeyin said nothing of such happened. “This is fake news. The market association agreed that shops would remain closed yesterday and today. Igbo traders this morning decided to renege on the agreement and open shops,” the Lagos police spokesperson said. “Some hoodlums took it upon themselves to enforce compliance. The police was alerted. “The police arrived promptly. The hoodlums fled upon sighting police patrol vans. Not one shop was vandalized. Not one person was robbed. Not one person was injured. Normalcy was swiftly returned and officers remained on ground.”
