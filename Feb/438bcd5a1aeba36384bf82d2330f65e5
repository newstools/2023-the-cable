Pius Oko, the executive secretary of the Lift Humanity Foundation (LHF), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), has called for the reorientation of people who are in denial of the negative effects of climate change. Speaking at a post-COP27 and pre-COP28 consultative workshop in Abuja, Oko said the impact of climate change in the country is real and citizens should be educated on how best to tackle it. “We strongly need more advocacy and sensitisation, especially for those climate deniers who have refused to understand the impact of climate change in our environment. Climate change issues are too important to be left in the hands of deniers,” he said. “So, we need to educate them to let them know that the climate change we are talking about is real and it is impacting us negatively.” He called for the collaboration and intervention of relevant stakeholders to address environmental crises in vulnerable communities, especially as it affects youths and women. “We want all stakeholders to come together and ensure that the voices of the vulnerable, those that have been suffering from the impact of climate change, are heard,” he said. “It is not a discussion for policy makers; it should be a decision that concerns people at the grassroots. So, let us come together and make sure that voices are being heard through strong advocacy.” While making reference to the 2022 floods and its devastating effects, Oko said there is a need to build climate resilience especially at the community levels, to ensure that environmental crisis is tackled effectively. Toyin Chukwudozie, the executive director of Education as a Vaccine (EVA), said women and girls should be allowed to participate in climate change policy processes and decision making at all levels. “There is a need to have a gender balance and inclusion in selection of decision making bodies such as the senate committee on ecology and climate change and other relevant committees,” Chukwudozie added.
