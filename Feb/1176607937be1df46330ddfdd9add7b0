The National Population Commission (NPC) says more than N400 billion has been earmarked for the forthcoming census. The NPC had, in November 2022, said it would need N532.7 billion to conduct the census. The census is scheduled for March 29 till April 2. Speaking on Monday when he presented a paper at a one-day capacity building workshop for journalists in Jos, Jick Lawrence, head of NPC public affairs department in Plateau, said about N100 billion had so far been expended on preparations ahead of the exercise. “Over N400 billion has been earmarked to be expended on the 2023 census,” he said “About N100 billion has so far been expended on preparations ahead of the exercise. Census is a very big and capital intensive exercise.” Lawrence also said census has far-reaching socio-economic gains, and that some of the funds would go into the empowerment of about 1.5 million Nigerians. He said those empowered would be paid monies ranging from N100,000 to N150,000 each. He added that 56,000 vehicles would be hired to enhance movement of personnel and materials, and about 800,000 personal digital assistants (PDAs) would be procured. Lawrence said the reflation of the economy, through the circulation of cash transferred into the hands of functionaries and clients who supply infrastructure and services, would add value to the economy. He added that census is critical to development, and therefore, deserves critical attention. Lawrence said more items would be added to the questionnaire issued to households, which include ICT literacy, fertility and child survival, as well as deaths in the household in the last 12 months. He added that other questions will touch on difficulties in performing activities, sanitation, and climate change.
