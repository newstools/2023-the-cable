Wale Okunniyi, a chieftain of the Labour Party (LP), says Peter Obi, standard bearer of the party will win the presidential election on Saturday by 12pm. Speaking on Thursday on Channels Television’s “the 2023 verdict”, Okunniyi said by 2:30 pm on election day when voting ends, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) would be collating the results because the LP candidate would have won by noon. “My optimism tells me that by the first ballot [Peter Obi will win] straight. My analyses give me that optimism and the level of hard work some of us have put in,” Okunniyi said. “We will be shocked that by 12 noon, it would be clear that we have won. I am telling you what I have analysed. “By 12 noon, you will know that we have won. It may not be official but you will know now when there is a trend. “By 2:30 pm that voting ends, it is just to collate. If you are in a polling unit for instance, and you see the trend and you have canvassers, information would have gotten to you. “In my polling unit, what has happened so far is that in three hours it is clear [the winner is known] and the INEC officials would just be playing.”
