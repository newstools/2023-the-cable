The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) says state outfits are not allowed to participate in security management during the general election. State security outfits include Amotekun of the south-west, Benue volunteer guards of Benue state, and Ebube Agu of the south-east. In a statement on Wednesday by Olumuyiwa Adejobi, force spokesperson, the IGP said no state security outfit or private guard is allowed to participate in elections in terms of security management. He also warned security officers not on election duty to avoid polling centres or face sanctions. “The IGP sternly warns all security aides and escorts to desist from accompanying their principals and politicians to polling booths and collation centres during the election as anyone found flouting this directive will be severely sanctioned,” the statement reads. “He emphasises that only security personnel specifically assigned to election duties are to be seen within and around the designated election booths and centres. “Also, the ban on the unauthorised use of sirens, revolving lights, covered number plates, and tinted glasses is still in force, and violators would be sanctioned appropriately. “All State-established and owned security outfits/organisations, quasi-security units, and privately-owned guard and security outfits are also barred from participating in election security management.”
