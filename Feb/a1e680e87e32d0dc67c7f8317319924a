The Flying Eagles of Nigeria defeated hosts Junior Pharaohs of Egypt 1-0 in their Group A encounter at the Africa Under-20 Nations Cup Group (AFCON) on Wednesday evening. In the second group match between the two winless sides, Solomon Agbalaka’s bullet header was enough to seal a victory that gave Nigeria its first points of the championship. The host, who gave as good as they got, had two excellent opportunities to take the lead in both halves but were unable to beat Chijioke Aniagboso, the Eagles’ agile goalkeeper, who saved at point-blank range on both occasions. Agbalaka delivered the telling blow on 71 minutes when he rose highest to plant Mohammed Aminu’s header into the roof of the net. The hosts continued to try but could not breach a defence that improved after the goal. Ladan Bosso’s boys saw out five minutes of added time to clinch full points. The Flying Eagles are second in the group with three points, two ahead of Egypt in third. They will face Mozambique in their final group match on Saturday, 25 February.
