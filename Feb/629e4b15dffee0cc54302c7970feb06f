The Zamfara government has ordered all unregistered non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating in the state to “pack their belongings and leave immediately”. In a statement on Tuesday, Mamman Tsafe, commissioner for security and home affairs, said the government has noticed an increase in the number of NGOs operating in Zamfara. Tsafe said some NGOs engage in illegal operations that contribute to insecurity in the state. “This is to notify the general public that government has observed with utmost dismay, the recent high influx of non-governmental organisations into the state, carrying out illegal activities that contravene the existing laws of government,” the statement reads. “It is further noted that majority of these illegal NGOs have not registered with the state in line with the laid down rules and regulations of government. Some of them have also been found to be engaging in activities fueling insecurity in the state and its neighbourhood. “Henceforth, the government orders all NGOs in the state to pack their belongings and leave the state immediately. Ministries and departments of government have been ordered to stop any further relationships with any NGO, as punitive measures will be taken against any MDAs found having any relationships with such NGOs. “Security agencies in the state are by this announcement directed to investigate and prosecute any NGO operating in the state without due clearance from designated authorities.” Making further clarification on the affected NGOs, Tsafe said only unregistered organisations have been asked to vacate the state. “We have cleared NGOs and those who are not cleared. So, we are only concerned about those who have gotten clearance from us. Those who are with us are with us and right now, they are working in our MDAs. But those who are not cleared should leave,” he told TheCable.
