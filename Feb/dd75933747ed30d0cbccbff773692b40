A federal high court in Abuja has fixed June 5 for the arraignment of Stella Oduah, former aviation minister, over N5 billion fraud allegation. Although the court had fixed February 13 to commence trial, the matter was not listed on the cause list. Further inquiry revealed that the case has been adjourned till June 5. Oduah, senator representing Anambra north, is to stand trial alongside eight others on a 25-count charge bordering on alleged conspiracy, money laundering, and maintaining anonymous bank accounts with First Bank Plc. Other defendants are Gloria Odita, Nwosu Emmanuel Nnamdi, Chukwuma Irene Chinyere, Global Offshore and Marine Ltd, Tip Top Global Resources Ltd, Crystal Television Ltd, Sobora International Ltd, and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Nigeria Ltd. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alleged that Oduah misappropriated public funds worth N5 billion while serving as a minister. Although the case came up for arraignment several times in 2021, it was stalled for several reasons. On November 22, 2021, Oguh Onoja, a defence counsel, raised an objection against the arraignment of the defendants, stating that he had written a petition to the AGF on the grounds that the defendants were “being persecuted”. The case file was later transmitted to the office of the AGF for a review of the matter. In October 2022, the AGF gave approval to the EFCC to commence prosecution.
