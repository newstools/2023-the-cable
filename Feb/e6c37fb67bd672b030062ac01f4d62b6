Ayobode Lokulo-Sodipe, judge of the Ondo state court of appeal, is dead. Lokulo-Sodipe clocked 67 on February 15. The judge was said to have slumped in his office while dressing up to attend a court session on Monday. All attempts to revive him were ineffective and he passed away before reaching the hospital. Rotimi Olorunfemi, the immediate past chairman of the Akure branch of the Nigeria Bar Association, confirmed the incident in a message. “Just confirmed it (the judge’s death); it is true. He collapsed in the office at court of appeal, Akure, this morning,” he wrote. “[He] was rushed to the hospital but confirmed DOA (dead on arrival).” Also, Banji Ayenakin, chairperson of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Akure branch, confirmed the judge’s death in a statement. “The news of the demise of Hon Justice Lokulo-Sodipe came to me as a rude shock,” he said. “My lord was a quintessential judge, very intelligent and forthright. “I commiserate with his family and the president of the court of appeal, Nigeria. “The entire members of NBA Akure will surely miss his promptness, forthrightness and commitment to the development of justice in Nigeria.” Lokulo-Sodipe was appointed as an appeal court judge in February 2008.
