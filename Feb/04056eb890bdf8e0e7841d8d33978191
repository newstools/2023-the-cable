The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council says the police Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) has invited Femi Fani-Kayode, a former minister, for questioning. In a statement on Wednesday, Bayo Onanuga, the council’s media director, said the police invitation was extended to him on Tuesday. The secret police are currently grilling Fani-Kayode, the campaign council’s director of new media for tweeting that Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), met with army generals. Onanuga said the council was not questioning the authority of the police, noting that the information they were seeking was already being pursued by the DSS. “Despite the well-publicized invitation of Chief Femi Fani-Kayode by the DSS and the report that the secret police asked him to return for further investigation today, we were surprised that the police have also jumped into the same matter,” he said. “On Tuesday the AIG Federal Investigation Bureau also invited Fani-Kayode for questioning. “The APC-PCC is concerned about the latest invitation by another security agency, just some 10 days to the election when he is most needed as our director of new media. “While we are not questioning the authority of the police to invite our official, we want the police to be mindful that the truth they seek to find is already being pursued by the DSS. “They should allow the DSS to complete its investigation.”
