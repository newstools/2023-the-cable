Ikenga Ugochinyere, spokesperson of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), says his house in Imo state is currently under attack. Ugochinyere, via a WhatsApp message shared on Tuesday afternoon, said his house was attacked with “explosives”. “SOS, WE ARE UNDER ATTACK AGAIN. MY HOUSE IS UNDER ATTACK AGAIN BY ARMED MEN WITH EXPLOSIVES AND HEAVY GUNFIRE,” the message reads. The development comes days after gunmen attacked his residence in Umukegwu community, Akokwa, Ideato LGA of the state. The gunmen invaded Ugochinyere’s residence while he was having a meeting with some of his supporters. During the attack, his uncle and some other persons were killed in the attack. Vehicles were also reportedly razed by the gunmen. Ugochinyere is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Ideato north and south federal constituency of Imo. In recent months, residents in Imo have been targeted by gunmen. Security operatives have attributed the attacks to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), but the separatist group has severally denied the claims.
