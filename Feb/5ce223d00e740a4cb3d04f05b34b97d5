Chelsea were defeated 1-0 by Southampton in their English Premier League (EPL) clash at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The Blues who spent over £300 million in the January transfer window huffed and puffed but were silenced by the relegation-threatened Southampton, thanks to a James Ward-Prowse winner. Paul Onuachu, Super Eagles of Nigeria striker, lasted an hour for Southampton after joining the club before the transfer deadline in January. A free-kick won deep into first half extra-time was expertly dispatched by Ward-Prowse to set Southampton on the path of an unlikely victory at halftime. Graham Potter’s side came out with more bite in the second period but could not find the rhythm and connection to breach Southampton’s defence that faced little pressure from their hosts. The latest result means Chelsea have not won in four league matches and remain lost in the mid-table, wandering in 10th position with 32 points from 23 matches. Elsewhere, Arsenal regained top spot in the league after a 4-2 win at Aston Villa. The Gunners took the top spot after Manchester City were held to a 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest. RESULTS
