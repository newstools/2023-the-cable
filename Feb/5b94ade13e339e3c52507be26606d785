The Police Service Commission (PSC) will drop controversial politician, Naja’atu Bala Muhammad, from election oversight duties, TheCable understands. Muhammad had resigned from the All Progressives Congress (APC) and endorsed Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Last week, she spoke about how Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the APC candidate, would be stopped from winning the presidential election. However, on Sunday evening, her name was listed as one of the PSC commissioners that will oversee the activities of the police during the general election. She was assigned to the strategic north-west zone, which boasts of the highest number of states and also the largest number of registered voters. Following a strong-worded complaint by the APC presidential campaign council, she will be dropped from the list, TheCable has confirmed from senior government officials. “The issue was brought to the attention of the minister of police affairs, Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi, who also contacted the leadership of the commission,” a senior official told TheCable. “He was told her name was recommended by a senior police officer at the force headquarters. A decision was immediately taken to drop her to avoid further controversies.” After saying she had retired from active politics, Muhammad openly endorsed Atiku and accused Tinubu of not having any plans for northern Nigeria. There are fears in Tinubu’s camp that some actions by the federal government in recent times appear to be directed at undermining his chances in the election. However, President Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated his support for the former Lagos state governor. On Sunday, Buhari’s media team released a video address calling on Nigerians to vote for Tinubu. Muhammad is vocal supporter of Buhari.
