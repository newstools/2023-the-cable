He is the man that we want, he is the man of the people,” NAN quoted Akinlade as saying. “Senator Bola Tinubu is a preacher of state police which will bring about peace and stability in the country and also combat insecurity in the land. “Tinubu believes in equity and justice. He is a man that believes in one Nigeria. We know too well that when he becomes the next president, the economy of the nation will be better.” Also speaking, Adeyemi Abiola, a chieftain of APP, said the party took the decision to make Nigeria better. “We have seen what he has done, and we believe he can do more at a time when Nigeria needs someone to give them hope. We believe in him and we know he can do better,” Abiola said. Also present was Adenipekun Mode-Adekunle, identified as the ZLP chairperson in Lagos.
