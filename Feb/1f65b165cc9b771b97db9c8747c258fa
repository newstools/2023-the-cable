With a few days left to the general election, some members of the Labour Party (LP) in the north-west zone have endorsed Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Peter Obi, a former governor of Anambra, is the standard bearer of the LP. Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Bashir Ishaq, speaking on behalf of some LP candidates in the north-west, said they are ready to work for Tinubu’s victory using their structures in the zone. Ishaq, who now leads the Game Changers For Asiwaju/Shettima, said they have all defected to the ruling party. “As a coalition of LP gubernatorial, senatorial and house of representatives and house of assembly members from the north-west, chairmen and members of campaign council, members of the gubernatorial campaign council in Kano and the north-west and zonal state coordinators, we have decided as a group to unanimously endorse the candidature of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu,” he said. “We have also resolved to leverage our existing political structures to work on the mobilisation and swinging of votes to ensure his emergence as the president of the federal republic of Nigeria in the 2023 presidential election. “We shall be known as the Game Changers for Asiwaju/Shettima 2023 and our slogan is ‘swinging votes’. “By decision, we have also made the firm decision that we have returned to the fold of the All Progressives Congress.”
