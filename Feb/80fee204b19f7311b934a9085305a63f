Residents of Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun state, have taken to the streets to protest the lingering scarcity of petrol and naira notes. In 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced the plan to redesign the N200, N500, and N1,000 notes, and asked Nigerians to deposit their old notes before January 31, 2023, when they would cease to be legal tender. However, with an adjustment of the deadline to February 10, Nigerians have found it difficult to obtain the new naira notes. Concurrently, there has been a steady increase in the price of premium motor spirit (PMS) which has been accompanied by long queues at filling stations across the nation. The currency and petrol crises have incited multiple protests across the country. Speaking to TheCable, a resident of Abeokuta, who identified himself as Taofeek, said the protest on Tuesday started at a branch of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) located in the Asero area of the city. “It all started at GTBank, Asero, before it extended to the major and strategic places in the city. More like a coordinated or planned protest, it was so fast,” he said. Kehinde Emmanuel, another resident, said one person was shot while several bank branches were vandalised. He told TheCable that the police, however, have restored normalcy in the area. “The protest started in the morning, from Asero down to Itoko. I got to Sapon around 1pm, and I noticed a bonfire under the bridge there. I saw flames coming from the bridge close to an Access Bank branch in the area,” Emmanuel said. “They are protesting both petrol and naira notes scarcity. They have destroyed branches of First Bank, Access Bank in Sapon, while Asero’s branches of Polaris and GTBank have also been destroyed. “The police are already around and things have been calm. But someone got shot in his arm.”
