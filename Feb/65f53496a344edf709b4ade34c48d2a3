Kashim Shettima, the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has done its best with regard to the general election. Speaking on Saturday after he cast his vote at the Shetimari unit 001 of Lamisula Jabbamari ward in Maiduguri, the Borno capital, Shettima urged residents to be patient and peaceful. He, however, expressed concern over the late arrival of election materials when he earlier arrived at the polling unit around 9:30am for the exercise. “As a leader, we have to look at this from a different angle. I believe INEC has done its best and I have cast my vote now. Our people are also casting their votes peacefully,” he said Expressing optimism about victory for his party, Shettima said he believes the APC has what it takes to win the election. “We have worked for it and it is going to be a win for us. My principal, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is a man of integrity and he knows his onions,” he said. “We are going to win, but I urge those who will lose today to ensure they put Nigeria first and sheath their swords for peace in our country.”
