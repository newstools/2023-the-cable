Bridget, mother of Nnaemeka Ugboma, a judge, has asked the Imo state government to find out those responsible for the murder of her son. Ugboma, who is also the chairman of the customary court in Ejemekwuru, Oguta LGA of Imo state, was shot dead when gunmen invaded the court during proceedings on February 2. A source from the community told TheCable that the bandits arrived on motorcycles and proceeded to the courtroom where the judge was presiding. The incident ended the court proceedings as lawyers, court staff, and litigants scampered for safety. Speaking with journalists in an interview on Saturday, the 78-year-old mother demanded justice for her son. “My son was an easygoing person,” she said. “He was more of an introvert as barely socialized with many. He had no issue with anybody to warrant his killing. I’m still confused about where this is coming from. “It was my second daughter that informed me about his death. Although, she tricked me by telling me that he was sick and needed attention. On getting to his house in Owerri, I noticed something was wrong because of the crowd that surrounded his house. “Nnaemeka was my first son and a judge. They told me that a group of armed men stormed his court at Ejemekwuru and shot him dead for no just reason. “I call on the government and police to try and fish out those behind my son’s killing and bring them to book. “Lawyers in the state are very much concerned about his death and they have promised to get to the root of the matter till justice prevails. They recently protested his death and matched the streets of Owerri. “All I want is vengeance for his death. Those behind his death must be arrested and brought to book.”
