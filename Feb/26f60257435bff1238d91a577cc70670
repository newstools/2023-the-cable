The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says it has recovered an additional N900 million for the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). In a statement on Sunday, Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesman, said the commission released the funds to the NHIS on February 8. The anti-graft agency said the sum “was part of the monies which some deposit money banks fraudulently withheld since 2015, and refused to remit into the NHIS’ treasury single account (TSA)”. The recovery is the latest in a series of reclamation of funds from banks by the EFCC to NHIS. “The recovered funds were released to NHIS on February 8, 2023, two days shy of one year, when the Commission, on February 10, 2022, also released the sum of N1,500,000,000.00 recovered from the banks to the NHIS,” the statement reads. In August 2022, the anti-graft agency released N1.4 billion to the scheme. In July 2021, the EFCC recovered N5.4 billion for the scheme. In September 2021, the commission also released N1.3 billion said to have been recovered from the banks to the NHIS.
