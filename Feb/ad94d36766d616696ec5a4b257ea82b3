Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says he will ensure a smooth exploration of petroleum resources in the north-east if elected. In 2019, crude oil was discovered in the Kolmani River region at the border community between Bauchi and Gombe states, and in 2022, President Muhammadu Buhari flagged off the first drilling project in the area. Speaking on Tuesday during the PDP presidential campaign rally in Bauchi, Abubakar also said he will “revive” the rail lines connecting the north-east. He said this will make it easier to transport petroleum products from Gombe and Bauchi to other parts of the country. The PDP candidate also said he would invest in the empowerment of youths and women in order to discourage restiveness and other forms of anti-social behaviour across the country. On his part, Bala Mohammed, governor of Bauchi, expressed optimism that all the party’s candidates would be victorious in the forthcoming general election. Also, Iyorchia Ayu, the PDP national chairperson, said Abubakar has all the required experience for the position of president, adding that if voted into power, PDP would correct the “ills” of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration.
