D’Tigers have defeated Ivory Coast 72-63 in their opening game in the fifth window of the ongoing FIBA World Cup qualifiers. The Nigerians conjured an inspiring performance in Luanda, Angola, on Friday to improve their chances of qualifying for the competition billed for Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines later in the year. The victory was a reverse of the 78-66 loss D’Tigers suffered against the Ivorians in the first match of the fifth window last year. While the Ivorians had already qualified for the World Cup and were unbeaten in their last seven games, the Nigerians showed more hunger to halt their brilliant form. Ogoh Dauda, the team’s head coach, named a predominantly home-based roster for the qualification window. The starting line-up consisted of Michael Afuwape, Victor Ezeh, Ibe Agu, Victor Anthony and Chinedu Chimbuo and the players embodied the renewed determination of the team. D’Tigers imposed themselves on the game from the tip-off and took the first quarter by 16-15. The Ivorians resumed with vigour in the second quarter, wrestling back control of the tie and opening a 34-30 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Nigeria resumed their domination and regained the lead 52-48. D’Tigers continued their intensity into the final quarter and ended the game with a 9-point gap victory over the Ivorians. Ezeh led the Nigerian with 18 points and three rebounds, followed by Isreal Otobo with 13 points. D’Tigers move to third in Group E with four wins in eight games. Nigeria will face Guinea on Saturday before going against Angola in the final match on Sunday.
