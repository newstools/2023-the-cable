The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has condemned Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere, a socio-cultural group, for saying Nigeria would not survive if Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) does not win the presidential election. Adebanjo had also said there will be no opportunity for a non-Christian, a non-northerner to be president again if Obi loses. Reacting on Friday in a statement signed by Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, the director of publicity and advocacy, NEF described Adebanjo’s comments as “irresponsible and condemnable”. “In his usual rantings, this time in campaigning for Mr Peter Obi of the Labour Party, he said, among other inflammatory outbursts, that if Nigerians do not elect his candidate, it will be the end of Nigeria. This statement is, to say the least, irresponsible and condemnable,” the statement reads. “It is the worst thing that can be said in promoting a candidate, but that is the business of the candidate. We do not believe that Chief Adebanjo’s reckless outburst reflects the quality or essence of the Obi/Datti ticket.” The forum said Nigeria’s unity is not dependent on intimidation or actions that will destabilise the elections. “Nigerians will not be scared from exercising their choices freely,” he said. “The unity and survival of Nigeria are not dependent on politicians who think they can intimidate citizens, or instigating actions that will subvert a credible election and a peaceful transition to the next administration. “If there are Nigerians with any influence over Chief Adebanjo, they should advise him to show respect for his age and all the advantages he enjoys from being a Nigerian.”
