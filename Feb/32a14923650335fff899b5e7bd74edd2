The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday conducted mock accreditation of voters to test the bi-modal voter accreditation system (BVAS). Mahmood Yakubu, the chairman of the commission, had announced that the exercise would take place at 436 out of the 176,846 polling units across the nation ahead of the elections. When TheCable visited Ikeja LG in Lagos on Saturday, there were reports of a smooth process at the two designated polling units (PUs). Electoral officers arrived at 8am at the polling unit in Irewole/Joseph street. As of 9.30 am, over 15 voters had been accredited out of 500 registered voters at the PU. Speaking with TheCable, Gabriel Taire, electoral officer for the LG, said he was “satisfied with the turnout”, adding that the “process has been largely outstanding”. He said the outcome of the mock accreditation has shown that INEC is fully ready for the elections. “The mock exercise has been fantastic and excellent. As of now, we have accredited about 13 people and it hasn’t failed anybody,” he said. “I’m satisfied with the turnout of the people. In the other wards where the exercise is taking place, there hasn’t been any issue of hiccups. The process is going smoothly, we should expect nothing less in the election.” At Anifowose/Ikeja PU,  23 voters were accredited out of the 543 registered voters. Madam Chinyere, a registered voter, commended INEC for its improvement, noting that the BVAS would make voting easy. “INEC showed that they have really improved as regards this 2023 elections and we commend the effort and love it,” she told TheCable. “Actually, if you come with your own voter’s card, the process will be easy. The machine will capture your face and thumb to show that you are the rightful owner of the card but whereby you come with another person’s card, it will not capture you, which means there is something wrong.” Meanwhile, TheCable observed the presence of security personnel at the two PUs. In Abuja, although the BVAS worked well, only a few residents came out for the mock exercise. At the post office polling unit, Area 10, there was a low turnout of voters while in Karu, only two persons came out for accreditation. However, residents of Iho PU in Ikeduru LGA of Imo turned out in their numbers. Nobleiyke Edoziem, a leader in the community, who spoke to TheCable, said that the process was “100 percent efficient”. “If the sensitive materials or equipment that will be used on the 25th election will be functioning optimally like this mock exercise, I bet, there will be better results at the end of the day,” Edoziem said. Christopher Ogudiri, another resident, expressed confidence that more people would turn up for the exercise. “This is 006 and it has served as the Ikeduru collation centre for years. That was probably why the government recommended it for the exercise,” Ogudiri told TheCable. “We had over 20 voters so far attended to and more people are still coming despite the fact that today is Eke-Iho market day. This is to tell you how politically aware our people are.” There was also the presence of security agents at the PUs in Imo. ABUJA        LAGOS              IMO
