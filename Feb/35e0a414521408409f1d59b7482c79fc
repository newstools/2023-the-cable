The Citizens Network For Peace and Development in Nigeria (CNPDN), a support group of former president Goodluck Jonathan, says Bola Tinubu, standard bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is the president that Nigeria needs. In the build-up to the APC primary election, the group had wanted Jonathan to run for a final term of office on the ruling party’s platform. But Jonathan declined and even disowned another group that bought him the presidential nomination form of the APC worth N100 million. In a statement on Wednesday, Francis Okereke Wainwei, the group’s national secretary, said Tinubu is the only candidate that could unify the country. “Power shift to southern Nigeria is the consensus of the majority of Nigerians, who believe in the future of this country because they believe that it is the best means of strengthening our national unity and cohesion,” Wainwei said. “Our choice of Bola Tinubu is strongly premised on his wealth of political experience, intellectual sagacity, a knack for identifying and recruiting competent people, and the capacity to mobilize human and material resources for the accelerated and holistic development of the country. “We strongly believe that the next president of this country should be someone who firmly believes in the philosophy of ‘building the people, to build the nation’, he should be a people-oriented president. “Tinubu fits perfectly for the kind of president Nigeria needs in the next dispensation. He has the capacity and the wealth of political experience to replicate the success story of Lagos State engineered by him, for both the economic and political stability of this country. “He is a national patriot and a detribalized leader that has the visionary mindset to build a prosperous, strong, peaceful, and united Nigeria.”
