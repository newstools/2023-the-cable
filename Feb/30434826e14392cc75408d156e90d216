The federal high court in Abuja has directed Usman Baba, inspector-general of police, to provide security for Ikenga Ugochinyere, spokesperson of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP). Eleojo Enenche, the presiding judge, gave the order after Ugochinyere filed an ex parte application. Apart from the police and the IGP, the fundamental human rights suit had the army, navy, air force, and the Department of State Services (DSS) as respondents. In two months, the home of Ugochinyere in Imo state has been attacked at least thrice. In January, Ugochinyere’s uncle and some other persons were killed in the attack on his home located in Umukegwu community, Akokwa, Ideato LGA of Imo. The CUPP spokesperson has since accused the authorities in Imo state of being responsible for the attacks. The court order seen by TheCable reads: “An order is hereby made directing the inspector-general of police to, within the 24 hours take measures that are necessary to ensure the protection of the life and property of the applicant. “Where this is not done within 24 hours, the 1 to 5 respondents are hereby ordered to step in and provide the needed security pending the determination of the substantive action.” February 27 was fixed by the judge to hear the substantive suit.
