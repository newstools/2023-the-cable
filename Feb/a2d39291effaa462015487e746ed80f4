The Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) has confirmed an oil spill incident in Ebubu, Eleme LGA of Rivers state. SPDC is the Nigerian subsidiary of oil multinational Shell Plc. Micheal Adande, a spokesperson for SPDC, in a statement on Saturday, said a government-led joint investigation team is working to identify the cause and impact of the incident. “The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) confirms an incident within our right of way on the Ebubu and Oghale Manifold 12 pipeline in Rivers State,” the statement reads. “A government-led joint investigation team is working to identify the cause and impact of the incident.” Fineface Dumnamene, executive director, Youths and Environmental Advocacy Centre (YEAC), in a statement seen by TheCable, called on industry stakeholders to investigate the incident. He said the spill has been ongoing for the past three days and that the spill point was yet to be clamped. Dumnamene quoted community sources as saying the spill is suspected to have been caused by equipment failure and is subject to joint investigation visit (JIV) confirmation. He alleged that some residents were trying “to cover up the oil spill for Shell” in exchange for aggrandisement and gains. “Advocacy Centre, a frontline youths and environmental advocacy organisation in Nigeria that works with communities in the Niger Delta region to address environmental concerns, seek ecological and environmental justice as well as campaign against environmental pollution among others is in direct contact with members of the network in the community as well as some community leaders and would release more details about this new oil spill in Ebubu Community (Ogoniland) as soon as practicable,” the statement reads.
