Daniel Bwala, a spokesperson for the Atiku Abubakar presidential campaign council, says Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) cannot win one northern state in the forthcoming poll. In an interview with Channels Television on Thursday, Bwala said the total number of Obi supporters will not make up the number of supporters that turned out in Katsina for the PDP presidential campaign rally. “Peter Obi is a third force. But Peter Obi is not revolutionary. Peter Obi cashed into a movement — an agitation by young people who feel they need a different path,” Bwala said. “And then what Peter Obi did, he was a member of the PDP; he was running in the PDP. If he had gotten the ticket, he wouldn’t have gone there. “Even after he left the PDP, he didn’t go to Labour Party. He was scouting for a political party. “The reason why I don’t bother about Peter Obi, let me tell you today by my discipline of law. Peter Obi as we speak today is running as an independent candidate. He is not a member of Labour Party. “Now let’s come down. Where will Peter Obi win? He cannot win one state in the north, the entire north, because we engage in rallies, in campaigns and we listen to people. “The same Peter Obi that they are manufacturing all the 419 polls, have you not seen his rallies? All the rallies Peter Obi has had now, all the rallies put together, are not up to our rally in Katsina.” Bwala’s comment comes hours after Ibrahim Abdulkarim, a chieftain of the LP, said Obi will get more votes from the north than the south in the general election.
