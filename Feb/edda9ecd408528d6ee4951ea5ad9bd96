Phrank Shaibu, aide to Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on communications, says Nigerians will transition out of the frying pan into fire, if Bola Tinubu is elected as president. In a statement on Sunday, Shaibu said the “Renewed Hope” message of Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is nothing but “hopelessness in disguise”. “Amid the excitement and tension, voters must guard their hearts jealously as the ruling APC will try to use every subterfuge and stratagem in its manual to deceive them once more,” the aide said. “These last days are similar to the end time predicted in the Holy books. Nigerians must not let themselves be deceived by this corn-man selling renewed hopelessness disguised as renewed hope. “Your hope will be stolen from you if he is allowed to govern Nigeria. That indeed will be a state of hopelessness – hell on earth, frying pan into fire.” Shaibu expressed dismay that Tinubu who claimed to be fighting for the masses over the naira redesign policy did not say anything when the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) went on strike for months. “These are people who never muttered a word when students spent 10 months at home in 2020 and eight months at home in 2022 due to unprecedented university lecturers’ strike,” he said. “These are people that never criticized the President at the height of the insecurity when schoolchildren were being abducted almost on a daily basis and when the naira witnessed a free fall that led to a sharp increase in the price of goods.”
