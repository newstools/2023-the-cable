The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers has accused Rotimi Amaechi, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain and former minister of transportation, of “secretly working” with Atiku Abubakar. In a statement on Monday by Ogbonna Nwuke, Rivers PDP communications director, the party accused Amaechi of working with Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate, to win the presidential election. “Only recently, he reconciled with members of the Presidential Campaign Council in Rivers State as part of the carefully woven plot. We equally know for certain that he has been holding secret meetings with the PDP presidential candidate,” the statement reads. “We challenge the former Minister of Transportation to deny this fact. Let him deny that he is not one of those that are working with Alhaji Atiku Abubakar at this time to undermine the genuine aspiration of the people of Southern Nigeria.” The Rivers PDP also alleged that there is a “cabal” behind the current scarcity of naira notes and petrol shortage. Since late January, the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been followed by a legal tussle between some states and the federal government, while protests have erupted in parts of the country. Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, in an interview, alleged that there are saboteurs in President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration working towards the failure of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the polls. In the statement, the Rivers PDP claimed that the current naira scarcity is part of a plot to influence the general election. “Nigerians have been forced to go through the eye of the needle in search of money with which to meet their daily needs and feed their families,” the Rivers PDP said. “Unknown to most Nigerians, the vicious cabal that has made it a duty to inflict pain and suffering on the rest of us has done so deliberately in order to influence the outcome of the forthcoming elections.”
