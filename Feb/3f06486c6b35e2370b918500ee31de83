The National Union of Road Transport (NURTW) says it has appointed logistics coordinators to supervise the transportation of election materials and personnel in Lagos, Ondo, Osun, and Oyo states. The development comes despite the ban on the activities of the union in the aforementioned south-west states. In a letter to Mahmood Yakubu, the chairperson of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Friday, Kabiru Ado Yau, the general secretary of the union, said Rafiu Olohunwa, Oluwatoyin Olaoye, Rauf Fakorede, and Abideen Olajide have been appointed as coordinators for Lagos, Ondo, Osun and Oyo states. The union also listed names and contact details of all its officials who would facilitate the deployment of vehicles and monitor the delivery of election materials and personnel in states across the country. “I am pleased to inform your good self that the Union’s leadership has appointed coordinators to be responsible for monitoring and supervision the activities of our members to be engaged by the commission for its electoral activities at state and local government levels,” Yau said “To achieve effective and efficient delivery of logistics, those engaged are to facilitate the successful deployment of vehicles as well as to monitor and assist the state councils they are assigned to. “They are also required to lead a delegation of state officials to supervise the signing of any contractual agreement with INEC in respect of the 2023 general elections.” Meanwhile, INEC is facing criticism in Lagos over its decision to work with the Lagos state parks management committee for the distribution of election materials. Olusegun Agbaje, the INEC resident electoral commissioner, had said the commission will be “working against the law if INEC has to continue to work with NURTW or any other group that is proscribed in the state”.
