Tukur Buratai, former chief of army staff, has asked Nigerians to vote for Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a statement on Thursday, Buratai said Tinubu has the interest of Nigerians at heart and that if elected, the APC candidate would replicate the feats he achieved in Lagos across the country. Buratai also encouraged Nigerians to set aside sentiments and prejudice and do what is best for the country. “I want to urge all Nigerian voters to come out en masse and vote for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as their next president,” he said. “I say so because he means well for Nigeria, and he has a better plan to fix the country and take it to the promised land. “The evidence is very glaring for all to see. He has done it in the time past in Lagos and I am sure he has the wherewithal and capacity to replicate what he did across the country. “Let us all work together to salvage this country by electing leaders with capacity. Nigerians have no reason to fear anything; this election will be peaceful, free, and fair.”
