The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) says applications yet to be processed for more than 2 months will be tagged ‘abandoned’ and deleted. In a statement on Friday, the commission many applications have been abandoned, creating a burden on its database. It urged applicants who have their files abandoned to have them resolved or present queries on the registration portal. “It has been observed that a sizeable number of applications have been filed and abandoned on the CRP (companies registration portal) as a result of queries that have not been resolved,” the statement reads. “This is creating a burden on our database. Moreso, there is no certainty as to when applicants will comply to enable the process to continue. “In view of the above, all applications that have stayed up to 2 months on the CRP without action from the presenter or applicant shall be deemed abandoned and would be deleted from the system. “In the same vein, going forward, any application for registration that has been queried and is not attended to by the presenter will be deleted from the system at the expiration of 2 months from the date of the query. “The general public and our esteemed customers are therefore advised to resolve all outstanding queries on applications that have been abandoned on the CRP on or before April 14, 2023.”
