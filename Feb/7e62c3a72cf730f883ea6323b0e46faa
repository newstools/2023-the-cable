Some supporters of Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), have been attacked by hoodlums in Lagos state. Some of the supporters were said to have come under attack while on their way to Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) — the venue of the party’s presidential campaign rally. The hoodlums were said to have targeted the supporters to prevent them from attending the rally.  Yunusa Tanko, spokesperson of the LP campaign council, in a statement on Saturday, said nothing will stop the Obidient movement from going on with the campaign. “The Obidient movement is under attack in Lagos, they are stopping our people from coming to the TBS rally,” the statement reads. “Nothing can stop a movement whose time has come. Security operatives take note. We keep moving Obidently & Yusfully.”  TheCable understands that some of the party’s supporters were also attacked by hoodlums at the Jakande axis in Lekki and Adeniji Adele area of Lagos Island. Medical volunteers at the TBS are currently attending to those who were injured in the attack. Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, said the state criminal investigation department will investigate the matter and arrest the attackers.  “The injured and other witnesses are assisting the police with relevant information that would aid the apprehension and prosecution of the attackers,” he said. “This attack is reprehensible! It is verifiable that the command had stationed, since yesterday, patrol vehicles and officers at the Tafawa Balewa Square venue of today’s rally. We had already secured the venue to prevent any breakdown of law and order “The regrettable attack happened about 15km away from the rally venue. As earlier stated, the SCID will take over investigations towards apprehending and prosecuting the attackers.”
