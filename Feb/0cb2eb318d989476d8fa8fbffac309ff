Datti Baba-Ahmed, the vice-presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says the party will “sort” the petrol subsidy “scam” if elected. Speaking in an interview on Channels Television on Tuesday, the LP vice-presidential candidate was asked how the party hopes to get funds to run the country if elected. The issue of payment of petrol subsidy has been a hotly-debated topic in the public space in recent times due to its impact on government revenue. TheCable had reported that Nigeria spent N2.04 trillion to offset subsidy payments in seven months, even as it plans to spend about N6 trillion on subsidy by 2023. The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is among the groups that have declared support for the presidential bid of Peter Obi, LP presidential candidate. On numerous occasions, the NLC has kicked against the planned removal of petrol subsidy and called for the repair of refineries instead. Responding, Baba-Ahmed cited a reference to the “fuel subsidy scam”, adding that the LP administration will deploy Nigeria’s “wasted funds” into healthcare and education if elected. “In the first 100 days, by the time we sort the problem of fuel subsidy scam and we are able to deploy Nigeria’s wasted funds into healthcare and education, you will begin to feel it,” he said. He added that the LP administration will cut the cost of governance and channel the resources to other important sectors. Baba-Ahmed also said he and Obi have the capacity to deliver on what they have promised Nigerians. “We have the records. Peter Obi’s name is well-known. Where he [is] from, schools attended and age are well-known,” he said. “Records are not in doubt. The same applies to me. Nothing is in doubt; no international controversy; no international criminal case against us. “Good people are in short supply in a political system like ours. Where did you find the like of Peter Obi? They come once in a generation.”
