The National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) says the fire at the oil mining lease (OML) 18 operated by Eroton Exploration and Production Company has been put out. OML 18 is a large oil block located towards the south of Port Harcourt, Rivers state, and contains 11 oil and gas fields. On January 20, a fire, allegedly caused by vandalism and bunkering activity, engulfed the Akaso 15L wellhead in Degema local government area (LGA), Rivers. Eroton had confirmed the wellhead fire incident, saying “the Akaso6LS fire died out while Akaso15L is still on fire”. Speaking on the latest development on Friday, Idris Musa, director-general, NOSDRA, said the fire has been finally put out. “The oil wellhead has been secured by an indigenous well control firm Kenyon International West Africa Ltd,” he said. Musa said NOSDRA is engaging the operator of OML 18 for a joint investigative visit (JIV) to the site of the incident. In October 2022, a fire incident occured at two oil wells operated by Eroton in Rivers state. In June 2022, in the space of three weeks, two oil leaks occurred at OML 18, operated by the company. The company blamed all the incidents on “third-party interference”. Eroton acquired 30 percent interest in OML 18 and related facilities in the eastern Niger Delta, following the divestment by Shell Petroleum Development Company from some of its onshore assets in 2015.
