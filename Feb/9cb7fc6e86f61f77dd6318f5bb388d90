The United States of America has asked Nigerians to use the forthcoming general election to make their voices heard. The US’ position was shared in a video that featured Antony Blinken, US secretary of state; Samantha Power, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) administrator; and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US ambassador to the United Nations. In the 58-second video published on Wednesday, Blinken said the US government hopes for peaceful elections in Nigeria, adding that the country’s polls matter to the world. “Nigeria’s constitution, like America’s, begins with a simple and profound idea. And during this election, you, the people of Nigeria, have a chance to make your voices heard, to choose your future,” he said. “We strongly support a peaceful election. Your vote matters. This election matters — not only to Nigerians but to the rest of the world. The Nigerian people have a friend and partner in the United States of America.” On her part, Thomas-Greenfield said the US is not supporting any candidate. “The United States does not support any individual candidate for office. Free and fair elections in Nigeria help create a freer and fairer world for everyone,” she said. “We are invested in your success. Our shared democratic futures depend on it.”
