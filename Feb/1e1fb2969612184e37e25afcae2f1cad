Sunday Dare, minister of youth development, has charged members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) involved in the 2023 general elections to be good ambassadors of the scheme. About 200,000 corps members have undergone training across the country to function as presiding and assistant presiding officers during the polls. Speaking on Thursday in Abuja, Dare challenged the corps members to discharge their responsibilities with fairness. He also warned them to “shun every form of temptation” while discharging their duties. “The elections are very significant and those of you picked and trained to play such important roles should be firm and fair, shun every temptation and be our good and worthy representatives,” he said. The minister made a passionate plea to the corps members to conduct themselves with maturity, stay above board and ensure they carry out the tasks assigned to them with a high level of patriotism and commitment. The presidential and national assembly elections will hold on Saturday while the gubernatorial and state assembly polls are scheduled in most states for March 11.
