Tobi Amusan, the world record holder for 100m hurdles, has been nominated for the 2023 Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year award. The 25-year-old world hurdles champion alongside five others made the list released by the organisers on Monday. The award, launched in 1999, is aimed at honouring individuals and teams from the world of sports along with sporting achievements throughout the year under review. Amusan is the first Nigerian to be nominated for the award. Other contenders for the prize are Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan, Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz, the US duo of Scottie Scheffler and Nathan Chen, and the Moroccan national team. Here are the six Nominees for the 2023 Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year Award: @carlosalcaraz  #ElenaRybakina  @EnMaroc @nathanwchen  #ScottieScheffler  #TobiAmusan #Laureus23 — Laureus (@LaureusSport) February 20, 2023  Amusan had a breakthrough year in 2022 when she became the first Nigerian to be crowned world champion after storming to a sensational 12.06 seconds in the 110m hurdles final — but a strong in-race tailwind which was higher than allowed meant it was not acknowledged. She consolidated her feat with a gold medal at the 2022 Commonwealth Games before retaining her Diamond League title to put a brilliant wrap on her season. Meanwhile, for the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year Award, Lionel Messi will contest with Kylian Mbappe, Stephen Curry, Rafael Nadal, Max Verstappen, and Mondo Duplantis for the prize.
