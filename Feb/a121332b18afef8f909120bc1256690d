Godwin Obaseki, Edo governor, has directed that the state’s transport service should convey passengers free of charge following the cash scarcity. There has been an outbreak of protests in Edo, among other states, as a result of the scarcity of naira notes. In a statement posted on his Twitter page on Thursday, Obaseki said he hopes to – through the free bus charges – reduce the effect of the cash crunch on Edo residents. “I have directed that beginning from today, Thursday, February 16, 2023, all Edo City Transport Service (ECTS) buses are to provide free services to passengers, as a means of reducing the effect of the cash crunch experienced by the people,” he tweeted. “The directive is applicable to all routes and is effective till Monday, February 20, 2023, after which further announcement would be issued on the matter. “The government calls on the people to remain calm and law-abiding and assures that normalcy will be restored shortly.” Free bus services by ECTS to cushion effect of cash crunch1/3 pic.twitter.com/lrzYzBfwAn — Godwin Obaseki (GGO) (@GovernorObaseki) February 16, 2023  Edo is not the first state to announce relief packages for residents amid the cash and petrol scarcity. Lagos and Ogun have begun distributing food items to “vulnerable residents” to reduce the hardship occasioned by the cash scarcity. The Borno state government earlier on Thursday announced that residents unable to obtain cash will be entitled to access free drugs at government hospitals.
