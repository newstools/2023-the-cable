Douye Diri, governor of Bayelsa state, says the currency redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has “brought the Holy Ghost fire” on those preparing bullion vans to buy votes. He spoke on Monday at the campaign flag-off for Sunday Katung, candidate for Kaduna south senatorial district in Zonkwa, headquarters of Zangon Kataf LGA. Diri said although he is not in support of the hardship Nigerians have been subjected to as a result of the naira redesign policy, he said it will change the attitude of Nigerian leaders. He pleaded with the CBN to ensure that the people do not suffer by making the new naira notes available. “We have to reset this country. The way the country is going is not about religion and ethnicity. It is about few people who have taken the wealth of this country to themselves,” he said. “While we are not in support of the common man suffering as a result of the sudden CBN policy, but that policy will change, not only our currency but our attitude towards everything as leaders. “While we plead with the CBN to ensure that our people do not suffer, on the other side, those of them who have bullion vans, who are prepared to make bullion vans and buy over the presidency, we say the Holy Ghost fire will go onto them. “The CBN policy is Holy Ghost fire on them. That is why they are shouting. Why are they shouting as if it affects them more than us? “All that CBN is saying is that nobody who does not earn money should have money in bullion vans to go and buy over our voters. “That’s all the CBN has said and we support that policy. However, make the money available to those who have earned this money through their farms, tradings and their professional business. “That’s all we are saying. That’s our concern. For us in PDP, we believe that Nigeria is going down and it must be rescued and recovered.” Diri said the only way the country can be rescued and recovered is to vote for Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the PDP.
