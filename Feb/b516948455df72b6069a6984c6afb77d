Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says if elected, his administration would set aside a $10 billion fund to promote business in the south-east. The former vice-president spoke at the PDP campaign rally in Abia state on Saturday. He said the rehabilitation fund is a promise he made to traders in the region in 2019. “My vice president has announced that we are going to set aside $10 billion to make sure that we support businesses, particularly in this part of the country,” he said. “I remember in 2019 when I came here, I addressed a group of businessmen from the south-east generally because Aba is the capital of the southeast as far as business is concerned. “I remembered I addressed all Igbo businessmen and promised them that I am going to support them and set out a lot of money for the rehabilitation of businesses in Aba. So, it is still there.” Atiku added that he would also ensure that the Abia dry port project becomes operational. “It will only be my pleasure to make sure that the dry port functions and are operating,” he said. On his part, Ifeanyi Okowa, PDP vice-presidential candidate, said the party would halt the “suffering” of the south-east and “restore the dignity of Igbo man”. “We know that the south-east has suffered under the APC administration,” he said. “This is not the country we used to know; we want to restore the dignity of Igbo man, we want a president that can unite Nigeria.”
