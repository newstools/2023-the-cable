The federal government has reacted to a claim by Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, that there are “elements” in the Aso Villa who are working against the All Progressives Congress (APC). Earlier on Wednesday, el-Rufai had alleged that some persons within the government are not happy with the outcome of the APC presidential primary and, as such, are working against the party winning the election. “Most of the people in the villa are not members of our party. I believe there are elements in the villa that want us to lose the election because they didn’t have their way,” the Kaduna governor said. “They had their candidates, and their candidates didn’t win the primaries and I think they are still trying to get us to lose the election and they are hiding behind the president’s desire to do what he thinks is right.” However, reacting to the claim while speaking with journalists, Mohammed said the focus of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration is ensuring credible elections. “One thing I can assure you is that no matter who, this administration is focused and determined to ensure a free and fair election and I think in this administration, the most important person is Mr. President, and I think he has shown by words and by deeds that he’s committed to a free, fair
and credible election,” the minister said. “Fair, free, and credible election actually means not favouring anybody or disadvantaging anybody. And everywhere he goes, he makes that very clear. Even as recently as Friday, when he was in Daura, he said the same thing. “So, if there’s anybody who’s working against any candidate, we don’t know officially.”
