Christian Atsu, the Ghanaian footballer who plied his trade in the Turkish Super Lig, has been found dead in the rubble of the deadly earthquake in Turkey. The 31-year-old Ghanaian had been reported missing following the devastating earthquakes which have claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria since February 6. Tremor from the earthquake had hit Atsu’s residence and Mustafa Ozat, Hatayspor’s spokesperson, previously said the footballer had been found alive but was injured. This was refuted by Murat Uzun Memhet, the Ghanaian’s agent, as the search for the former Newcastle United player continued. But on Saturday morning, Mehmet, the Turkey-licensed football agent, revealed that Atsu had been found dead. “Christian Atsu found and sadly passed away,” Mehmet wrote on Twitter.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their prayers and support “I ask that whilst we make the necessary arrangements, that everyone would please respect the privacy of the family during this very difficult time.” Atsu played in 258 matches and scored 24 goals. His last match produced his last goal — an injury-time winner from a long-distance free-kick.
