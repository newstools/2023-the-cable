At least 800 Nigerians have been arrested and detained by the Saudi Arabian government for issues bordering on illegal migration. In a statement on Friday, Gabriel Odu, spokesperson of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), said the Saudi Arabian government intensified a clampdown on irregular migrants in October 2022. “The attention of the management of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission has been drawn to a communication from the office of the secretary to the government of the federation on Saudi Arabian authorities intensifying crackdown on undocumented foreigners in their country,” the statement reads. “The letter stated that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia has between October and December 2022, intensified joint operations across the country targeted at riding the kingdom of undocumented irregular migrants. “In the communication to the Federal Government of Nigeria, the Saudi Arabian government noted that about 45,458 foreigners ranging from violation of residency rules, illegal border crossing attempts and irregular migrants for labour-related offences are in the country. “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has about 800 Nigerians arrested and detained for various offences particularly consular issues since the clampdown began in October 2022.” Odu said although the Nigerian embassy in Saudi Arabia is intervening in the matter, it would be necessary for Nigerians to avoid breaking the laws of other countries to prevent similar situations. He urged Nigerian citizens to travel legitimately and with necessary documents, adding that President Muhammadu Buhari is in talks with President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to lift the suspension of the visa ban on Nigerians travelling to the country. In 2021, Nigeria evacuated hundreds of its citizens from Saudi Arabia. after they overstayed their visas and were left stranded.
