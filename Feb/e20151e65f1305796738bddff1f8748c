The Centre for Social and Economic Rights (CSER) has called for the arrest of Paul Enenche, the senior pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, for his “inciting message” on the collation of the presidential election results. In a statement issued on Monday by Nelson Ekujumi, its executive director, the group said the messages are a “threat to national peace and security”. On February 26, in his sermon to congregants, Enenche had decried the involvement of  “human demons” and their “lunatic agents” in the disruption of a peace election in some states. Ekujumi described the message as “irresponsible, insensitive, reckless and provocative”. He said the group is “disturbed and frowns at the provocative and reckless message of incitement being unleashed on hapless Nigerians by Paul Enenche and others of like minds with the intention to cause a disruption of public peace and order for personal political advantage which is condemnable”. “We are shocked and condemn in strong terms the double standards that is being openly displayed by the DSS who invited an APC campaign council media director Chief Femi Fani-Kayode for questioning over comments termed as a threat to national security while they seem to be looking the other way at this brazen effontery of Pastor Paul Enenche against the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” Ekujumi added. “Therefore, as we await the announcement of final results and declaration of winners of the 2023 general elections at the national collation centre in Abuja, we are demanding the immediate arrest and prosecution of Paul Enenche for comments that are capable of disrupting public peace, truncating, and toppling  our democracy which amounts to treason under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
