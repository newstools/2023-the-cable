The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has warned Nigerians against making comments capable of triggering crisis in the country. Muyiwa Adejobi, force spokesperson, in a statement on Saturday, urged Nigerians to remain calm and embrace peace, as the federal government is working hard to address the naira and fuel scarcity. Adejobi also called on Nigerians to desist from any act of violence that may jeopardize the forthcoming elections. “Amidst the prevailing outcries and reactions on the new naira policy in the country, the Nigeria Police Force has deemed it necessary to caution groups and individuals against divisive comments and utterances capable of heating up the polity and triggering a crisis in the nation,” the statement reads. “This call is highly imperative as the police perceive the reactions and utterances of certain groups and individuals as an attempt to heat up the polity, and spontaneously instigate the populace against the government and its policies. “Similarly, the Nigerian populace is hereby urged to desist from any act of violence, hooliganism, and vandalism that may jeopardize the ongoing electoral process, which is significant and critical in the transitional advancement of democracy in Nigeria. “Meanwhile, the NPF will like to assure the general public that it is working in concert with defence, security, and intelligence agencies to provide a peaceful environment for all citizens to conduct their socio-economic activities.”
