Christian Atsu, Black Stars of Ghana winger, is reportedly trapped under the rubble after two consecutive earthquakes tore through Turkey on Monday. According to the UK Sun, the 31-year-old, who plays for Turkey’s Hatayspor, has gone missing since the tremor ravaged his home in the Kahramanmaras, the city where the club is based. He is yet to be found alongside Taner Savut, Hatayspor’s sporting director. A search and rescue team has been dispatched after the two missing individuals. Atsu scored the late winner for Hatayspor in their Turkish league clash against Kasimpasa on Sunday. He joined the Turkish club last September after a brief spell with Al-Raed in Saudi Arabia. The Ghanaian spent four years in the books of Chelsea FC before moving to Newcastle United in 2017. TheCable had reported that more than 1,300 people have died in Turkey and Syria after a couple of earthquakes hit the Mediterranean region. According to the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre, one of the earthquakes which struck Turkey was at least 7.5 magnitude. Hundreds of buildings were completely destroyed in the quake, with tremors felt as far as Cyprus, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt. Hours later, there were reports of major tremors in the affected region. Turkish President Recep Erdogan said rescue teams have rescued over 2,400 people from under the rubble of buildings flattened by the quake, the worst to hit the country in 100 years.
