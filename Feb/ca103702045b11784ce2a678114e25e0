He added that more information would be provided in due course. “Following the distress call received in the early hours of today 6/2/2023 from Omor and Anaku in Ayamelum LGA, the joint task force comprising of Police and military has been deployed to the area,” Ikenga said in a statement he shared with TheCable. “The presence of these security forces has reinforced the security of life and properties and enhanced the provision of law and order in the area. “Meanwhile, the fact of the incident is still unclear and patrols/operations are still ongoing and the situation is being monitored. “Further developments shall be communicated.” Both communities have been involved in conflict said to be linked to land dispute. In 2021, Uche Okafor, speaker of the Anambra house of assembly, led a delegation to the areas over crisis involving both communities. In its report on the 2021 crisis, the Anambra Broadcasting Service said “the affected communities especially Anaku, where the local government headquarters is sited, was a ghost of itself as no single youth was seen in the area”.
