The Atiku/Okowa campaign organisation says Nigerians should not vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the presidential election. Kola Ologbondiyan, the spokesperson of the Atiku campaign council, in a statement on Tuesday, said the APC has nothing to offer Nigerians. He also accused Bola Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate, of causing problems within the APC, and urged Nigerians to “approach the ballot box with a determination to repay the APC and Tinubu for the devastation they caused our country”. “Nigerians must go to the presidential election with the consciousness of how the arrogant, abusive, insensitive, corrupt and incompetent APC and its presidential candidate viciously pillaged our national patrimony, turned our revenues generating agencies into their cash cows, wrecked our once robust economy which was hitherto rated as one of the fastest growing in the world, ruined our productive sectors, took away jobs from our youths and turned our nation into the poverty capital of the world, where over 100 million Nigerians can no longer afford their daily meals and other basic necessities of life,” the statement reads. “It is therefore instructive for Nigerians to observe that the APC presidential candidate is at the centre of all the woes that characterised the APC administration. He is the initiator and architect of the anti-people policies of the APC administration that have brought pain and hardships to Nigerians. “This election is a referendum on the eight years of the APC, a government that Tinubu claimed to have personally installed under which Nigerians have suffered untold hardships. “The 2023 presidential election is a grand opportunity for all Nigerians to liberate themselves from the atrocious APC by voting en masse for Atiku Abubakar, who is leading the charge in the mission to rescue, recover and rebuild our nation from the misrule of the APC.”
