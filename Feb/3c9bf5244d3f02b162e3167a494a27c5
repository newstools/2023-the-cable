The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says its operatives have arrested three suspects for allegedly being in possession of 20 permanent voter cards (PVCs) in Edo state. The suspects are Afekhana Esther, Comfort Muoneke, and Segun Osaimokhai. The anti-graft agency, in a statement on Sunday, said Esther, one of the suspects, was arrested in ward 1, St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, Ikpoba Okha in Benin city with 20 PVCs belonging to different people. EFCC said the suspect alleged that she was given the PVCs by Muoneke and Osaimokhai. It said the suspects would be charged in court after the investigation. Unlawful possession of PVCs is a violation of the electoral act 2022. Section 22 of the act states that:  “Any person who — (a) is in unlawful possession of any voter’s card whether issued in the name of cards any voter or not; or “(b) sells or attempts to sell or offers to sell any voter’s card whether issued in the name of any voter or not; or “(c) buys or offers to buy any voters’ card whether on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not more than N500,000 or imprisonment not more than two years or both.” Security agencies have been arresting those who attempted to buy votes and those caught with multiple PVCs in the presidential and national assembly elections. On Saturday, the EFCC said its operatives intercepted a woman with 18 voter cards in a sting operation in Badarwa area of Kaduna state.
