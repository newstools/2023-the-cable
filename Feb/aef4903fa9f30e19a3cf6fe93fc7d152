Ireti Kingibe, a senatorial candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the federal capital territory (FCT), says there is a plot to manipulate election results in the nation’s capital. Speaking with reporters in Abuja on Monday night, Kingibe said some unnamed people were looking for reasons to cancel the results. She alleged that some thugs invaded a centre in Gwarinpa district and tore up presidential collation sheets. “It was stressful, I know thugs went to Gwarinpa collation centre, they entered there, they attacked and tore up presidential collation sheets,” Kingibe said. “Suddenly, they said they found an error in the results, alleging that it was over voting but the people said to them ‘no, it is not and if it is an error, you can’t penalize the candidate for it’. “They [INEC staff] said it is not their job to look at the result sheet but it is their job to take whatever is on the result sheet. “What kind of country are we running? What the establishment and its people are looking for because we have had enough. When we complain they say ‘go to the polls’, we have gone to the polls and they still insist that it is not enough. “The will of the people must prevail. Look at the man that they want to impose on the senatorial seat.”
