The transition committee is headed by the secretary to the government of the federation. Buhari spoke during an audience with Gambo Aliyu, director–general of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA), a statement by Femi Adesina, special adviser on media and publicity to the president, said. He said all the accomplishments made in the fight against prevailing diseases would be highlighted in the roadmap. The president assured that his administration was committed to eliminating HIV/AIDs and other public health emergencies, noting that progress has been made in achieving a sustainable system through combined efforts. ‘‘I wish to acknowledge the important role played in enabling the significant infrastructural investment developed over the years for HIV control, to the fight against COVID-19, Monkeypox, Lassa fever, and other emerging infectious diseases affecting our people,” he was quoted as saying. ‘‘Gradually our determined efforts with the support of our friends, the nation’s preparedness and capacity to respond to public health emergencies is growing stronger by the day. ‘‘To this end, the federal government will continue to work with the leadership of the governor’s forum and the organized private sector to continue to provide adequate resources and sustainable financing for the national response to HIV.”
