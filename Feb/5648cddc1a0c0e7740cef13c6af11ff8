Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, has asked Lagos residents to avoid any act of violence in the wake of his loss to Peter Obi in the presidential election held in the state. Obi, the candidate of the Labour Party (LP), has been declared the winner in Lagos — a state which has always been a stronghold of Tinubu. In a statement released hours after Obi was announced as the winner, Tinubu said the outcome of the election should not be a source of provocation. “The fact that the APC narrowly lost Lagos state to another party should not be the reason for violence. As a democrat, you win some, you lose some. We must allow the process to continue unhindered across the country while we maintain peace and decorum,” he said. Tinubu polled 572,606 votes behind Obi who had 582,354 votes. Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) garnered 75,750 votes, while Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and Adewole Adebayo of Social Democratic Party (SDP) had 8,442 and 772 votes respectively. The former Lagos governor condemned reports of violence in parts of the state especially reported attacks on some traders of Igbo origin.
