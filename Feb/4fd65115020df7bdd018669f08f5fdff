Manji Gontori, the Young Peoples Party (YPP) governorship candidate in Plateau, has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Gontori, who joined the party with his supporters, announced his defection at the flag-off of the APC governorship campaign rally in Wase LGA of Plateau state. Gontori described his defection to the APC as a “homecoming” and enjoined stakeholders to ensure the party wins in the forthcoming general election. “My return to APC is homecoming, I will work with all stakeholders to ensure that APC wins general election. I implore all supporters to work assiduously to ensure that Nentawe Yilwatda of APC is elected the governor of Plateau,” NAN quotes Gontori as saying. While speaking at the event, Simon Lalong, the Plateau governor, said he was happy with the massive turnout of APC supporters at the party. Lalong described the turnout as proof that the APC remained the party of the masses. In his speech, Idris Wase, the house of representatives deputy speaker, said the party will continue to better the economy if voted into power in the forthcoming elections. “We will improve the state economy and 10 percent of the state’s internally generated revenue would be deployed to address issues of the vulnerable groups like the youth, women, and people living with disabilities,” Wase said. “We will be transparent, free, fair, and run an all-inclusive government while the youths will be mentored and appointed as commissioners and into other positions.” In his remarks, Yilwatda, the party’s governorship candidate, pledged to utilise potential of youths for growth, progress, and development of the state if elected.
