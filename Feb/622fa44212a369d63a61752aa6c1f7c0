Aminu Masari, governor of Katsina, says Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has donated N100 million to victims of banditry in the state. Katsina, the state where President Muhammadu Buhari hails from, has seen the activities of banditry grow over time. Recently, the police said 41 people were killed in an ambush by gunmen. Speaking at a campaign rally in Katsina on Monday, Masari said his administration was doing its best to curb the activities of criminals in the state. “When you play with leadership for a second, you will face the consequences for years. The 2023 general election is between brightness and darkness, and APC represents the brightness,” NAN quoted the governor as saying. “The earlier opportunity the other people had, they didn’t utilize it to help Nigerians, but the little we had, everybody has seen what we have done. “There was never a time that women and youths were involved in politics and election like now because President Muhammad Buhari had brought a lot of empowerment programmes. “Especially here in Katsina, over N37 billion was shared among the low-income people in the state within just six years. Therefore, you should shun anyone telling you lies. “You should vote for APC in the forthcoming elections.” Masari said if the previous administrations had got it right, parts of the country would not be experiencing insecurity.
