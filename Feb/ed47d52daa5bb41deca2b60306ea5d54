The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) says Nigeria must do more to stop the recruitment of children by armed groups in the country. In a statement to mark this year’s ‘Red Hand Day’, UNICEF said despite international efforts to eradicate the issue, children continue to be exploited by armed actors, with many cases unreported. The ‘Red Hand Day’ is dedicated to raising awareness and strengthening efforts to end the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts worldwide. Reflecting on the occasion, Cristian Munduate, UNICEF representative in Nigeria, commended the federal government’s efforts to tackle the issue. “In Nigeria, there have been numerous reports of children being recruited and used by armed groups, with devastating consequences on their physical and psychological well-being,” she said. “Red Hand Day is an important reminder of the ongoing challenge to end the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts. “We applaud the efforts of the government of Nigeria for the signing of the Handover Protocol for children encountered in the course of armed conflict in Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin Region. “This moment is also another opportunity for the Federal Government of Nigeria to endorse the Paris commitments to protect children from unlawful recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups and the Paris principles and guidelines on children associated with armed forces or armed groups.” The organisation said it would continue to support the efforts of the government to invest in the prevention of child recruitment by armed groups and facilitate the reintegration of those that exit armed groups in the north-east.
