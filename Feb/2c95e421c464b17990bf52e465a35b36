Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police (IGP), says governors cannot be prosecuted over alleged inciting comments on the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Baba spoke on Wednesday with journalists after the national security council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. Governors such as Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna and Dapo Abiodun of Ogun have openly countered the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari on the naira redesign policy. While the federal government has declared the old N500 and N1,000 notes as invalid, the two governors have said the notes remain legal tender pending the determination of a suit before the supreme court on the matter. Amid the directives and counter-directives, there have been protests in parts of the country, as well as attacks on banks, including in Ogun state. Speaking on the comments by the governors, which have been criticised in some quarters as “inciting”, the IGP said governors found culpable cannot be prosecuted by the police because they have immunity. “We all know why the governors have not been cautioned. We are investigating. Whoever does anything can be investigated,” he said. “But for him to be prosecuted, there are some people who have immunity. I think that is one of the reasons, but that will not stop us from cautioning them, from warning them, from advising them; and we are doing so.”
