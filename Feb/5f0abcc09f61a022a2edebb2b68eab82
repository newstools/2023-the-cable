Ten-man Manchester United returned to winning ways in the English Premier League (EPL) following a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon. A goal in each half from Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford was enough to hand United a first league win in three attempts. Jeffrey Schlupp, however, scored Palace’s consolation goal. Manchester United were handed the lead from the penalty spot when Will Hughes was adjudged to have handled the ball inside the area following a VAR review and Fernandes planted his spot-kick into the bottom corner to set the home crowd rocking. The Red Devils had to wait until the 63rd minute to double their advantage through Rashford’s placed shot from Luke Shaw’s cutback. Erik ten Hag’s side was reduced to ten men on 70 minutes when Casemiro was brandished a straight red card for chocking Hughes, and Crystal Palace capitalized to reduce the deficit six minutes later through Schlupp’s quick-thinking to stick out a leg and divert a wayward shot into the net. Man United, however, held on to secure a win that moved them to 42 points from 21 games in third place — tightening their grip on the top-four position while also making them potential title contenders. In the other games of the day, Liverpool continued their poor run after a 3-0 drubbing at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Arsenal’s EPL title bid also suffered a snag following a 1-0 loss at Everton. James Tarkowskis header was enough to give Sean Dyche a win in his first games since being appointed as Everton boss. The lethargic Gunners still hold a five-point lead at the top of the EPL ahead of second-placed Manchester City. Kelechi Iheanacho was also on the scoresheet as Leicester came from behind to win 4-2 at Aston Villa.
