Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says the natural resources in Zamfara should be a source of good for residents of the state. In his address on Thursday during the LP presidential campaign rally at the Ahmadu Bello stadium in Gusau, the Zamfara capital, Obi said his administration will unlock the potential of the state if elected. “My administration will unlock Zamfara’s potentials. Your natural resources should bring you good things, not crime. Zamfara state with its huge mineral resources has no business being one of the poorest states in the country.” In a statement by the Obi-Datti presidential campaign council, the LP candidate also said insecurity will be a thing of the past if the party wins the election. Obi, who promised to make security a priority, said youths will be productively engaged under an LP administration. He also advised residents to focus on character and competence when making their decisions on who to vote for in the general election. Obi’s comment in Zamfara comes amid attacks on communities in the state, which have led to killings, kidnappings, and displacement.
