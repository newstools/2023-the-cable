Kola Ologbondiyan, spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council, says Nigerians have decided to vote Atiku Abubakar in the general election. In a statement on Friday, Ologbondiyan alleged that there are attempts to use violence to disrupt the elections. The PDP campaign also accused Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), of inciting remarks, adding that such moves will not discourage Nigerians from participating actively in the polls. “It is clear that Tinubu is pathetically being driven by an entitlement mentality, and as such, he does not care about the unity of our country,” the statement reads. “In any case, Tinubu had since announced that he does not believe in Nigeria as a nation. It is therefore obvious that he is in the Presidential race for purposes that are not for the wellbeing of Nigerians; thus his readiness to set our nation on fire for his selfish purpose. “It is however pitiable that a two-term governor, who has been spewing divisive insults on the leaders of our nation, can make himself a willing tool just because of personal aggrandizement. “Our campaign calls on Nigerians to be wary and firmly resist the evil machinations of the Tinubu presidential campaign against our nation. “Tinubu and his co-travelers must come to terms with the reality that Nigerians across ethnic, religious and political divides have made up their minds to elect the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, as the next President and not even their predilections to violence, hate speech and blackmail can detract from this resolve.”
