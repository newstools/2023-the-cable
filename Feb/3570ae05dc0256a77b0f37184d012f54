The Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) says the second edition of the women’s T20 international cricket tournament will be hosted in Lagos from March 19 to 26. Speaking on Sunday, Uyi Akpata, president of the NCF, said work on the latest tournament had commenced since the end of the 2022 edition. “We have world-class facilities across the country and have a successful talent-recruitment program as well. So, the NCF Women’s T20 International is one of the avenues to showcase, groom, and maximise the use of those facilities. Our women’s national team is one of the most improved on the continent in recent times,” Akpata said. “This year’s event will feature all the teams that participated in the 2022 edition, with Cameroon being the only first-time entry. In addition, both the Tafawa Balewa Square and the University of Lagos ovals are being put in the best shape as the hosting venues.” The eight-day tournament also includes a rest day, where the players would be taken on a guided tour of Lagos before it is rounded off on March 26. At the maiden edition in 2022, the Rwanda women’s national team beat Nigeria to become winners at the Tafawa Balewa Cricket Oval, Lagos. Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Gambia also featured in the last edition, even as Gambia also used the tournament to stake its claim for ranking points on the International Cricket Council (ICC) T20i log.
