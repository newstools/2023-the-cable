Ikenga Ugochinyere, spokesperson of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), says President Muhammadu Buhari should order the release of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Terrorism charges are levelled against Kanu by the federal government. In October 2022, the court of appeal in Abuja struck out the terrorism charge filed against Kanu. The appellate court held that Kanu’s extradition from Kenya to Nigeria to stand trial was illegal. The federal government later filed an appeal before the supreme court challenging the judgment — and subsequently filed an amended charge before a federal high court. In a statement on Sunday, Ugochinyere said Buhari has more pressing security issues to worry about than keeping Kanu in custody. “Nigeria presently is contending with terrorism in the north-east; farmers-herders clashes and banditry in the north-central; abductions and armed attacks in the south-west; restiveness and attacks by unknown gunmen in the south-east, and abductions, cult wars, vandalisation of oil installations and oil theft in the south-south region,” he said. “The president has more pressing issues to worry about. He should know that the nation cannot enjoy peace so long as any part thereof is troubled. “Kanu can help tackle insecurity in the southeast, that’s why those who want the confusion in the region and Imo state in particular to continue will always oppose any move for the federal government to obey the court order for Kanu’s release. “I, therefore, renew my call, appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari to show statesmanship and fatherly introspection by ensuring the release of the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, from detention.”
