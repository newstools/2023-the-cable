Usman Yusuf, a former executive secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), says the people of Katsina will not vote for Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking in an interview on Channels Television on Monday, Yusuf, who is the special adviser on community engagement to the Atiku/Okowa presidential campaign, said Katsina people are tired of the APC-ruled government. “Our politics in Katsina has been vibrant from the beginning. We are not the people that anyone would say vote for this. If President Buhari raises his hand in Katsina. We will not vote for him,” he said. “People are tired, they are fed up. They brought hired crowd from Kano, we saw the buses from Kano. Ganduje loaded them from there. These politicians do a lot of stuff, so don’t believe the optics. The reality is on the ground.” Meanwhile, during the party’s campaign in Katsina on February 6, President Buhari, while calling for the people to vote for Tinubu, raised the hands of the former Lagos governor as a sign of endorsement for his presidential bid. Prior to that day, TheCable had reported that Buhari called Tinubu the next president of Nigeria at the party’s campaign in Nasarawa. The president had described him as a “competent Nigerian”, who will give all he has for the country.
