Cyprian Akaolisa, attorney-general of Imo, says over 100 people — including 83 members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) — have been killed in Orsu LGA in three years. Speaking on Tuesday with members of the Imo chapter of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), the attorney-general, who hails from Awo-idemili in Orsu, lamented attacks by gunmen on the LGA. TheCable had reported that Nnaemeka Ugboma, a judge and the chairperson of the customary court in Ejemekwuru, Oguta LGA of Imo state, was shot dead when gunmen reportedly invaded the court during proceedings on February 3. The NBA members protested the killing of the judge on Tuesday. “It will amaze you to know that over 100 people have so far been killed in my local government area, Orsu, by unknown bandits,” Akaolisa said. “Eighty-three of them are strong APC chieftains. Orsu and its neighbouring communities are currently on the run because these bandits have taken over all the nooks and crannies of the area. “I am a victim of the insecurity in Imo state. That is why it will be wrong to accuse the state governor or government of the Imo state of being responsible for the killings in the state. “If the Imo government is the sponsor, why has it been APC members that are falling victim? This is where we should ask ourselves questions. The governor has earlier said the rising insecurity is orchestrated by enemies of his government just to put him in a bad image. “I call on these gunmen to kindly accept the amnesty offer which the government has extended to them and drop their guns. Imo is the only state we can call our own. Why are we killing ourselves?”
