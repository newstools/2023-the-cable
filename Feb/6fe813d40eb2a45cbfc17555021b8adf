The Centre for Social Media Research (CSMR) says fake news on social media platforms is a threat to Nigeria’s democratic process. In a statement by Tunde Akanni and Akin Olaniyan, representatives of the the organisation, the CSMR said disinformation and misinformation have distorted political communication in the build-up to the election. “Nigerians need to be careful about purported endorsement by paid influencers who take their unsuspecting followers for a ride by publicly canvassing support for candidates while disguising their actions as borne out of any political ideology or a genuine belief in the Nigerian project,” the statement reads. Citing a reference to Wole Soyinka,  Nobel laureate, who recently denied claims that he was backing a presidential candidate, CSMR said it was worried that social media platforms are affecting the quality of information that ought to help Nigerians make informed choices at the polls. “Social Media is already becoming anti-social here,” the statement reads. “It is feared that if left unchecked, the growing incidence of so-called fake news portends grave dangers to Nigeria’s democratic process because it undermines trust in news; it further polarises a country that has so far struggled to knit its people together; and because it thrives on sensationalism, increases the potential for political violence that targets perceived opponents. “We make bold to enjoin Nigerian authorities to alert Facebook, Google and Twitter to relevant issues based on our experience relating with some of these concerns having taken time to seek the understanding of their operations and their concerns.” CSMR, therefore, advised Nigerians to be careful about sharing information through their social media accounts unless they have been able to confirm that it is true. It added that when Nigerians are in doubt, they should ask themselves if they are sure of the source and if it will it incite people to violence before they share.
