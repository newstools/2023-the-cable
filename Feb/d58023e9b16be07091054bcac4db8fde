Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says he will promote tourism in Kebbi state through the Argungu fishing festival. Speaking on Saturday during the APC presidential campaign rally in the state, he said he will support efforts to make the state a tourist destination. Tinubu also said he will promote initiatives to boost the agricultural and education sectors in the state. “We are going to invest in education and agro-allied industries to make prosperity a very simple thing,” a statement by his media office quoted him as saying. “We will manage water resources to make sure that Nigeria becomes a leading agricultural country in Africa.” He lauded Kebbi’s exploits in rice production, adding that he will further foster partnerships between the state and other parts of the country. In his remarks, Atiku Bagudu, Kebbi governor, encouraged residents to support the APC presidential candidate, considering his past investments in advancing democracy in the country. Also, Abubakar Malami, minister of justice and attorney-general of the federation, said with the APC’s efforts in agriculture, social welfare, and infrastructure, the party deserves to be re-elected. He said Tinubu shares a lot in common with President Muhammadu Buhari, adding that if elected, the APC candidate will consolidate on the gains recorded by the Buhari administration.
