The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) has directed oil marketers in the country to allow the use point of sale (POS) and bank transfer services for the sale of petroleum products. In a statement on Thursday, signed by Kimchi Apollo, the agency’s general manager, corporate communications and stakeholders management, NMDPRA said the directive was to alleviate the suffering of customers. The authority said it would sanction filling stations’ refusing to accept payments via POS and bank transfers. NMDPRA explained that the action was necessary following reports that some filling stations were refusing customers’ bank transfers and POS transactions despite the ongoing cash shortage in the country. “It has come to the attention of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) that some retail outlets are not accepting the use of point of sale (POS) machines at their filling stations due to the recent cash crunch brought about by the new naira design,” the statement reads. “The authority frowns at this recent behaviour which is causing untold hardship for Nigerians at a time when all hands should be on deck to assist the government in the transition to the new naira. “All retail outlets are directed to ensure the free use of POS and bank transfer for the sale of petroleum products to alleviate the suffering of customers at this critical time. “The authority and security agencies will be at retail outlets to ensure compliance with this directive and any filling station found violating this directive will be duly sanctioned.” NMDPRA also reassured the general public of its commitment to ensuring good quality service in the sale and distribution of petroleum products nationwide.
