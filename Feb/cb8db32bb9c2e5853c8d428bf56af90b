Obafemi Hamzat, the deputy governor of Lagos, has advised Nigerians to consider “competence, character, and network” when choosing leaders. Speaking on Friday when he featured on ‘Your View’, a programme on TVC, he said Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, has what it takes to bring true development to Nigeria. Hamzat also spoke on developmental efforts in Lagos, adding that the current administration remains committed to promoting policies that can better the welfare of residents. “Lagos state has a department called the resilience department. If there is a major shock around the world, how do we survive? Buying fire trucks is not accidental because these are the things we need. We are preparing in case there is a problem,” he said. While speaking on primary health centres (PHCs) in Lagos, he said there are about 418 PHCs in Lagos out of which 67 are flagship — those that are opened throughout the day. He, however, added that the state is working on efforts to ensure that all PHCs are open throughout on a daily basis. On his relationship with Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos governor, he said they have “no issues”. “We have been very close for 15 to 16 years. We have no issues. That is why we have been able to work together,” Hamzat said.
