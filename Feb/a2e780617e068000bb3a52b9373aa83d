The Borno chapter of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has directed members to suspend all operations. In a statement on Tuesday, signed by Mohammed Kuluwu, IPMAN chairman in the state, the marketers were also ordered to suspend the payment of ordering products from source until further notice. The association said the decision followed, “the critical situation as it affect our sourcing and selling of product at lost (sic) and the action of the authority to impose the selling of product at a lost price (sic) on our side”. “You are all hereby directed to suspend selling at all filling stations and also suspend payment of ordering products from source until further notice,” the statement reads. IPMAN had said regulatory agencies enforced the pump price of petrol at N195 per litre at all filling stations across the country. On Monday, the association’s western zone branch asked for more time from the federal government to sell its current petrol stock before conforming to the official price. In a related development, transport groups, under the aegis of the coalition of transporters, had threatened to picket the headquarters of the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited as a result of the lingering petrol scarcity which has also led to high pump prices.
