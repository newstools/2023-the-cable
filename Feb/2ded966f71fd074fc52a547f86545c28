Gunmen have killed Oyibo Chukwu, the candidate of the Labour Party (LP) for Saturday’s Enugu east senatorial district election. Chukwu was reportedly killed at Amechi Awkunanaw in Enugu south LGA of Enugu on Wednesday when gunmen opened fire on his convoy. The gunmen were also said to have killed five of his supporters who were with him in the car. Chukwu’s death comes days before the presidential and national assembly elections in the country. Chijioke Edeoga, the Enugu LP governorship candidate said the car conveying Chukwu and his supporters was set ablaze after they were killed. “It is true that our senatorial candidate for Enugu East senatorial district for Saturday’s election has been killed. They (gunmen) shot him and five others and set them ablaze,” The Punch quoted Edeoga as saying. “Our party members are being targeted for assassination by political parties that felt threatened by the rise of the Labour Party in the state and are afraid they may lose Saturday’s election.” Daniel Ndukwe, the spokesperson of the Enugu police command, could not be reached to comment on the incident at the time of filing this report. Chukwu’s death comes weeks after the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Enugu south LGA was attacked by gunmen.
