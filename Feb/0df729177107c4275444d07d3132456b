Adekunle Makama Oyelude, the Olowu of Kuta in Osun state, has appealed to Nigerians not to sell their votes during the general election. In a statement on Friday, the monarch urged the citizens to think twice before casting their votes as that will determine their collective future. He also appealed to the citizens to vote wisely because of the dire consequences of electing bad leaders. According to Oyelude, since it will take another four years to effect another change, voters must be sure of the leadership they are endorsing for the next four years. “Our sons and daughters, I urge you all to come out enmasse peacefully to exercise your civic responsibility on Saturday,” Oyelude said. “The constitution of Nigeria has bestowed on you the right to choose and elect a leader and leaders that will lead us in various strata. May God give you the wisdom to think wisely and vote wisely. “Don’t sell your votes. Your votes will determine our collective future as a country. So, I urge you all to use your voting power rightly. Elect a leader that’s God fearing, elect a leader that will lead us to the promised land. We don’t have any option to reverse any wrong decision you take on behalf of us all until after four years.”
