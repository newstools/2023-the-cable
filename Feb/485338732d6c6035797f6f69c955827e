The youth wing of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council, on Saturday, held a town hall meeting with youth groups in Gombe. The meeting was held at Maidugu Palace Hotel in the state capital. At the meeting, members of the north-east zonal chapter of the National Association of Nigeria Students (NANS) endorsed Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the PDP. Speaking on behalf of the group, Alhassan Adam, coordinator of NANS in the zone, said only Abubakar has shown a passion for education among the candidates. “It is time we make our voices heard. What we suffered as students of tertiary institutions recently (during the strike) is difficult to recount,” he said. “No nation desirous of making progress and catching up with the civilised nations of the world can afford to treat her students the way we were treated. “But this is not the time for lamentation. It is time for decision-making. We, members of NANS zone e, have decided to support the ambition of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and his running mate, senator Ifeanyi Okowa, of the PDP in this election.” Muhammed Suleiman, PDP national youth leader; and Timothy Osadolo, his deputy, were among those who attended the meeting.
