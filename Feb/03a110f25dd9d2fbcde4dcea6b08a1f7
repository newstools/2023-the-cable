Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has taken a swipe at Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP). While speaking to party supporters on Tuesday in Awka, the Anambra capital, Tinubu said Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), cannot be trusted to keep promises. The APC candidate cited a reference to the Bible on “Peter’s denial of Jesus Christ”. Tinubu, however, went on to refer to Obi in particular, saying the latter cannot “keep promise to God” and, as such, cannot be trusted to keep campaign promises. “The man who left here, he calls himself Peter Obi. We read in the Bible that before the cock crows three times, he will deny Jesus Christ,” he said. “He denied. So, how can he keep a promise to you, if he cannot keep promise to God? “How can a man be happy to keep his people at home, not working, and make them suffer because you want to prove a point. “Has Bola Tinubu not proved a point? Did I close any market? Did I kill anybody? It means I am smart; I’m a thinker; I’m a doer. I even tamed the Atlantic. God bless you.” See video below.
