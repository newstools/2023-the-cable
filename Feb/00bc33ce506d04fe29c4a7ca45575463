Several fighters of the Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have reportedly lost their lives during a series of clashes between the two camps. The fighting started on Tuesday after the two camps clashed at Kuwa Nguro and Ngoldiri communities located in the Timbuktu triangle axis in Damboa, Borno state. According to Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency publication, the clash lasted for three hours and led to the death of fighters on both sides. It is, however, not yet clear how many fatalities were recorded in the clash. Several other insurgents were said to have sustained injuries, while ammunition and motorcycles were seized from the Boko Haram camp. HOURS LATER, BOKO HARAM LOSES FIGHTERS To renew its field capacity, the Boko Haram group reportedly appointed one Ali Hajja Fusam as the new leader of the sect in Gaizuwa, a community in Bama LGA of Borno. However, a clash ensued after an attack on Fusam’s convoy in Gulmari village in Konduga LGA of the state, while he was returning from the camp of Ali Ngulde — Boko Haram’s overall field commander — in Mandara mountain. Sources told Zagazola Makama that Fusam received one gun truck, eight motorcycles, and weapons from Ngulde. While Fusam escaped the attack, 15 Boko Haram fighters were reportedly killed and one gun truck seized by the ISWAP camp. ‘BOKO HARAM FIGHTS BACK’ Things took another turn on Thursday as Zagazola Makama reported that six fighters from the ISWAP camp were ambushed and killed by Boko Haram insurgents in Burmari village in Konduga LGA of the state. Scores of the ISWAP fighters were also reportedly injured, while three of their motorcycles were seized while others withdraw to Hasanari village in Konduga after being “overpowered” by the Boko Haram camp.
