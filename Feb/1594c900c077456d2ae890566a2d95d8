The English Premier League (EPL) has accused Manchester City of breaching several of its financial rules following a lengthy probe. The league announced the charges in a statement published on its website on Monday. The club had allegedly broken the league’s financial rule from the 2009/10 season to the 2017/18 campaign. The statement added that City breached rules requiring the provision of “accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position” during the stipulated period. The club was said to have failed to clearly declare its revenue, including sponsorship revenue, operating costs and the full details of “manager remuneration”. EPL has tabled the allegations to an independent commission that will give a final verdict on the matter. “Commissions are independent of the Premier League and member clubs. The members of the Commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel, in accordance with Premier League Rules W.19, W.20 and W.26,” the statement reads. “The proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the Commission’s final award will be published on the Premier League’s website. “This confirmation is made in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1. The Premier League will be making no further comment in respect of this matter until further notice.” The investigation which kicked off in 2019 covered almost the period since Abu Dhabi United Group took over Manchester City in 2008. Under the new board, the Etihad became a stadium synonymous with success with six Premier League triumphs, two FA Cup wins, three FA Community Shield titles, and half a dozen Football League Cup victories. If found guilty by the independent commission, City, who are currently second in the league, may be hit with a huge points deduction or potential expulsion from the EPL.
