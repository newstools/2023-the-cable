Muktar Betara, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has won a fifth term in the house of representatives. Betara, who currently represents Biu/Kwaya Kusar/Shani/Bayo federal constituency in Borno, is the chairperson of the house of representatives committee on appropriations. He polled 71,427 votes to defeat his closest challenger, Mohammed Ibrahim Biu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who got 15,514 votes. Betara was first elected into the lower legislative chamber in 2007. Speaking on his victory, Betara said “there is no excuse“ to let his people down. “I want to particularly express my heartfelt gratitude to almighty Allah for making this day possible. This is a journey that commenced some months ago when they pooled their hard-earned money to get the nomination forms for me and today they have matched that commitment with further action by voting overwhelmingly for me to emerge once again,” he said. “As you can see, there’s no excuse or reason to let my people down when I return to Abuja because today, they kept their promise of returning me and it is my turn to fulfill my own end of the social contract we have entered into. “I will continue to do my best to represent their interest and put them first in my legislative decisions and activities in the next four years inshallah. “I also want to thank the leadership of our great party, the APC, for the continuous support and encouragement over the years. I pray for total victory both in the presidential and governorship elections so that together we can provide the quality leadership that Nigerians deserve.”
