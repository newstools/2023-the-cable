Simon Ekpa, a self-acclaimed disciple of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has been released by the police in Finland. TheCable had reported that Ekpa was arrested by police at his residence in Lahti, Finland, on Thursday. He was picked up by the police just before he was to grant a newspaper interview, a Finland-based newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (HS), reported. The platform also published a picture showing Ekpa being escorted by police officers at his residence. Hours later, HS reported that the Finland-based Biafra agitator had been released by the police after hours of questioning. Although Tommi Reen, an officer with the Central Criminal Police, did not state the identity of the suspect in custody, he confirmed the raid to HS. Reen, however, said the suspect was released after a few hours of questioning, adding that investigation is ongoing. “The person being questioned today is suspected of a crime. We will return to the title on Friday,” Reen was quoted as saying. Recently, Ekpa declared that there will be no elections in the south-east zone of Nigeria. Aside from the threat to elections, the Finland-based Nigerian had insisted that people of the south-east region must observe sit-at-home every Monday to protest the detention of Kanu. The sit-at-home directive has been reportedly linked to killings in the south-east. However, the leadership of IPOB through its spokesperson, Emmanuel Powerful, had distanced the group from the sit-at-home order issued by Ekpa.
