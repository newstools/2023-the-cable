The Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) has released a 12-man list for the final window of the qualifiers for the 2023 FIBA World Cup. The federation released the roster in a tweet on its Twitter handle on Tuesday. The roster comprises 11 home-based players, while Olatunji Graham, a free agent, is the sole exception in the team. Gombe Bulls have four players in the team namely Okiki Michael, Odufuwa Kanyisola, Wisdom Anyoha, and Abdulwahab Yakubu while Nigeria Customs are represented by three players in Micheal Daramola, Ibe Agu, and Isreal Otobo. Rivers Hoopers have two players — Johnson Anaiye and Victor Koko — while Kwara Falcons, the 2022 champions of the Nigeria Premier Basketball League, have just Victor Ezeh in the squad. D’Tigers are gunning to be among the other four African teams that would be joining Ivory Coast at the World Cup billed for Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines in August. Nigeria faces the herculean task of qualifying for the competition following a poor outing in window 4 of the qualifiers. D’Tigers recorded one win in three games, losing to both Ivory Coast and Angola, and worsened their chances of qualifying for the World Cup. The team will face Ivory Coast on Friday and play Guinea a day later before going against Angola in the final match. FULL ROSTER
