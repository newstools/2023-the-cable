The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) deployed its operatives across polling units to monitor the presidential and national assembly elections in the country. Nigerians went to the polls on Saturday to elect another president who will take over from President Muhammadu Buhari, whose tenure ends on May 29. While the elections lasted, operatives of the ICPC were seen in strategic places trying to ensure vote buying and other criminal activities did not occur at the polling units. Officials of the commission also teamed up with other security operatives at the election venues to ensure a smooth voting process. The ICPC is among the agencies leading the fight against the inducement of voters in the elections. On Friday, the commission seized N2 million in old and new notes linked to a politician in Gombe state. Below are photos of some of the officials at election venues:
