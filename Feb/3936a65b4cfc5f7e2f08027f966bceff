Peter Mbah, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Enugu, has promised the people of the state a better future if he is elected. Speaking at a rally held over the weekend, which featured supporters from several groups, the governorship candidate expressed his appreciation to residents who came out to support him. “First of all, I want to start by putting on record our deep appreciation for this resolve. You have shown enormous resolve in what you believe in,” Mbah said. “You have shown that you were with the PDP yesterday, you are with PDP today, and you are going to be with PDP tomorrow, and that tomorrow is right here with us. “I want to tell you that what you have done here today is a demonstration that you want to seize your tomorrow, and you want to reach out and bring your tomorrow here. “What that means is that you are already with us on this journey of greatness, this journey of growth, and this journey of development. “I want to promise you that, that tomorrow you desire, we are going to take you there because you deserve it. We are not going to let you down. And I want to join the convener in thanking God for the safe tour and bringing us back safely.” While addressing the crowd, U.S.A. Igwesi, convener and director of the support groups of the Enugu PDP campaign council, said the huge turnout of supporters is an indication that Mbah will win. “When we were planning this rally, we thought about two million people and some people thought we were joking. But today, the election is done and dusted. By the sheer number of people here, Enugu state still loves love PDP,” he added. “PDP is in the veins, PDP is in the arteries, and PDP is in the blood and DNA of the people of Enugu state. “The coming election is for us to formalise what God has ordained and what the people of Enugu have endorsed.”
