President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, met with Bola Tinubu, standard bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The meeting is said to have held at the villa before the weekly federal executive council (FEC) meeting. Details of the meeting are not yet known. The meeting is coming amid the controversial naira swap policy. In January, the APC candidate said the petrol scarcity and the naira redesign policy would not affect his chances of securing victory. “Hide the petrol, hide the naira, we will still vote; we will win!” Tinubu had said. “Even if you change the ink on naira notes, what you want will not happen. We will win. That umbrella party will lose. We will take this government from them — saboteurs that are dragging power with us.” His comments elicited debate as many persons believed he was criticising the president. The ruling party’s presidential campaign council later clarified Tinubu’s position, saying he was only warning the president of saboteurs in his administration. “No political blackmail and an attempt to create a conflict between Tinubu and his long-term ally, President Muhammadu Buhari can succeed,” Bayo Onanuga, the council’s director of media, said in a statement. The president has been attending some campaign rallies of his party’s standard bearer. Meanwhile, the supreme court has temporarily restrained the federal government from restricting the use of the old naira notes pending the determination of a suit filed by several state governments.
