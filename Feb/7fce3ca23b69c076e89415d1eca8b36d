Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, has called for an end to the protests rocking some parts of the state over the lingering naira scarcity. On Friday, commuters were stranded as a result of the protests that erupted around the Ojota area of the state, which also spread to Maryland, Ketu, Mile 12, and some parts of the Ikorodu. In a statement by Gbenga Omotoso, the commissioner for information, the governor asked residents of the state to shun any form of incitement over the naira scarcity. “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu believes there is no need for violence as the supreme court is looking into this controversial matter and will make its position known on February 22,” the commissioner said. “Lagos state has since joined the legal dispute — all in the interest of our people — in the belief that the highest court in the land has the capacity to adjudicate on the matter. “The fuel situation is easing following some steps taken by the government. The government praises Lagosians for showing understanding, despite the pains that the federal government’s measures have brought. Residents should continue to be law-abiding by shunning any form of incitement by mischief makers.”
