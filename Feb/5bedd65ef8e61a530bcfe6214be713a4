The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kogi has alleged that the state government is using the operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) against its members. In a letter dated February 6 and addressed to Yusuf Magaji, DSS director-general; Iliyasu Zubair, Kogi PDP zonal chairman, said members of the party are being detained arbitrarily. He said the state government is using the DSS operatives to arrest the PDP members without “no just cause”. “We are constrained to draw your attention to the unfortunate interference of the Kogi State Government in the affairs of the State Command of your department,” the letter reads. “Regrettably, the Kogi State Command of the Department of Security Service (DSS) has constituted itself into a witch-hunting tool of the state government, harassing our supporters, intimidating and detaining them for no just cause. “This worrisome trend is most prevalent in the Kogi Central Senatorial District where the State Governor hails from. In the last two (2) months, no fewer than thirty (30) of our staunch party faithful had been unjustly arrested, harassed and kept for weeks unending in the custody of the Kogi State Command of the Department of Security (DSS) under the pretence of investigation of fictitious allegations.” Zubair asked Magaji to move all the petitions against the PDP members in Kogi to the DSS headquarters in Abuja. “In the light of the foregoing, I respectfully request you to please, direct the Kogi State Command of the Department of Security Service (DSS) to transfer all petitions and ongoing investigations to the National Headquarters with immediate effect,” he said. “We are confident that the grant of our request would provide a level playing ground for all and such that may have a genuine need to appear in your office in the interest of equity and fairness particularly as it concerns our party supporters.”
