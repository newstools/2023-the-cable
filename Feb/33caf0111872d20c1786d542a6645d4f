The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) says it has arrested eight persons engaged in the production of “harmful” ice cream, yoghurt, and bread in Niger state. Speaking on Wednesday in Minna, the state capital, Shaba Mohammed, director, north-central zone of NAFDAC, said the suspects were arrested during a raid conducted by the agency in Suleja area of the state. He said the suspects sold the products to schoolchildren, adding that the agency also uncovered a bakery using potassium bromate for bread production. “During our surveillance in Suleja today, we discovered a cluster of 15 sites producing unhealthy ice cream, yoghurt and bread for school children in Suleja,” he said. “We immediately swung into action and eight suspects were arrested in connection with the unwholesome practices. “These products are unwholesome, we discovered the use of harmful chemicals in the products. “The products are being produced in an unhealthy environment. Some of these products can cause cholera, cancer and other health issues. “We want parents and school management to stop persons into such unwholesome activities from bringing their products into the school environment and report them to NAFDAC.” Francis Ononiwi, director of enforcement in the agency, said the suspects have been handed to the police for proper investigation and prosecution. Ahmed Yusuf, assistant chief regulatory officer, added that the agency will intensify efforts to ensure that the actual owners of the production companies are apprehended.
