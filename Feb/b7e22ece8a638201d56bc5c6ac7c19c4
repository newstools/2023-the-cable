Adamu Aliero, former governor of Kebbi, says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members in the state have resolved their differences. Aliero, who is the PDP candidate for Kebbi central senatorial district, spoke on Monday in Birnin Kebbi. In October 2022, over 500 members of the PDP in Kebbi reportedly defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC), citing “injustice”. Aliero said the PDP members in the state have resolved all grievances and are ready to take over power from the APC in the state. “PDP today is united. All aggrieved members have resolved their differences. We have come together as one big family and we are now ready to wrest power from the incumbent,” he said. The former governor alleged that the state government executed projects that were not commensurate with the money received from the federal government. The lawmaker asked residents in the state to support all PDP candidates in the elections, adding that the party will transform the nation for the “betterment” of all. In January, the supreme court affirmed Aliero as the PDP candidate for Kebbi central senatorial district. The appeal court in Sokoto had, in September 2022, nullified Aliero’s candidacy and affirmed Saidu Haruna as the candidate for Kebbi central. But the supreme court had, on January 31, affirmed Aliero as the PDP candidate for the senatorial district.
