Mohammed Ibrahim, the resident electoral commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Borno, has explained why there was a delay in the collation of presidential election results in the state. Speaking on Tuesday while giving an update on the collation exercise at the Sir Kashim College of Education in Maiduguri, the state capital, Ibrahim said some areas in the state are far and relatively inaccessible. He said that the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) sent to the northern and southern parts of the state had to be escorted by security operatives due to the difficulty associated with accessing the terrain and the need for safety. Collation resumed on Tuesday morning with the presentation of results from five LGAs â€” Bama, Kala Balge, Ngala, Marte, and Jere. Meanwhile, announcement of results across states is ongoing at the national collation centre in Abuja.
