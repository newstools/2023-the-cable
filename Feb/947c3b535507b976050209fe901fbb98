Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, says Nigeria will progress under the leadership of Bola Tinubu, standard bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking on Monday at a rally in Owo, a town in Ondo north senatorial district, Akeredolu said the people should vote for Tinubu so the struggle to have a president from the southern part of the country is achieved. “Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu is tested and trusted,” the governor said. “He has been governor of Lagos state and we know how he transformed the state. I can assure you, Nigeria will move forward under Tinubu as president.” On his part, Ade Adetimehin, chairperson of the APC in Ondo, said Akeredolu’s performance would earn victory for Tinubu in the state. “This is Owo. Akeredolu championed the struggle for southern presidency. Baba Ajasin championed the June 12 struggle. Another Owo man has championed Tinubu’s presidency,” Adetimehin said. “Let us go to our unit, ward and local government. It is time for Yoruba to be president. This election is for the progressive. Our country will move forward under Tinubu. “Vote Tinubu and all the senate, reps, house of assembly candidates under the APC. Don’t sell your votes.” The Ondo APC chairperson added that the ideology of the APC is “welfarism”.
