The players and officials of Akwa United FC have been attacked by armed robbers on their return from the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) clash against Kwara United. In a statement on its website on Friday, the club said the attack occurred along Ogoni road, Rivers, at 6:48 pm on Thursday. Akwa United were returning to Uyo from Ibadan following a 2-1 loss to Kwara United on Wednesday when it happened. The team’s convoy ran into a roadblock mounted by the assailants, but the drivers manoeuvred out of the trap, which led to the vehicles being pelted with dangerous weapons and the windows smashed. Emmanuel Udoh, the team manager, said the attack happened between two police checkpoints. He added that no life was lost during the incident. “The attack on our team along Ogoni road was one terrible experience and the psychological effects are what we need to put behind us fast,” Udoh said. “It was God that saved us from those hoodlums, who were determined to do anything to us. The worst part of it is that the attack happened in-between two police checkpoints. “On behalf of Akwa United, I want to use this opportunity to appeal to all security agencies to redouble their effort, especially along some well-known dangerous locations like Ogoni road.” The Promise Keepers are currently fourth in Group A of the abridged NFPL with seven points from five games. They face Remo Stars at the Godwill Akpabio stadium in Uyo on Sunday.
