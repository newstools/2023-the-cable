Four South African police officers who allegedly beat a Nigerian into a coma have been arrested. According to NAN, the policemen were arrested on Wednesday at the Boksburg north police station by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) after the Nigerian consulate in Johannesburg lodged a complaint about the incident. The arrested policemen were said to have demanded the identification papers of the victim and his friends. Lizzy Suping, the IPID spokesperson, said the Nigerian was thereafter arrested and taken to the police station when he could not produce the required documents. She said he was subsequently assaulted and tortured by the officers and was taken to the hospital where he was in a coma for nine days. The suspects, she added, would be arraigned at the Boksburg magistrate’s court on Thursday. Elizabeth Wale-Ayodele, an official of the consulate, said the Nigerian spent nine days in a coma. “Two weeks ago, 9th January 2023, a Nigerian was assaulted in Boksburg by four policemen. We received this at the consulate and immediately the CG (Consul General), Mr Andrew Idi, was here two weeks ago to pay the victim a visit,” Wale-Ayodele said. “He (the victim) was assaulted, thoroughly beaten, even when he complained of having kidney issues. He fell into a coma and was in a coma for nine days. “So when he came out of a coma, the CG was here to visit him and we opened the case with IPID. The consulate has followed up on the case up till this moment. “We are happy to see this happen. We are happy to see that Nigerians are not assaulted and perpetrators go scot-free. “We are happy to see justice prevail. We are happy to see that the consulate worked on this day and night. We are happy to see the result.” NAN said the arrested police officers will be facing charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice.
