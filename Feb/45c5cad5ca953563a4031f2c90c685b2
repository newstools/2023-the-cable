The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that the forthcoming elections reflect the wishes of voters. Joseph Ajaero, president of the NLC, said this in a statement on Monday following the meeting of the congress’ national administrative council (NAC). He advised Nigerians to participate actively in the elections, and also ensure they safeguard their votes. “NAC warned that the disruption of the electoral process by parties, politicians or their aides or privies or by whoever will not be acceptable to it or the generality of Nigerians who have invested their time and resources,” the statement reads. “NAC called upon the security agencies to guarantee the safety of voters, observers, INEC officials, and all those associated with conducting free, fair, and credible elections across the country during the elections. “NAC similarly urged INEC to ensure that the electoral processes are not only transparent and fair but reflect the wishes of voters. “NAC said the Nigeria Labour Congress together with other dispassionate organisations or individuals cannot afford to be indifferent or passive in the forthcoming elections and strongly warned those with sinister agenda to steer clear.”
