Nana Sechere, the agent of Christian Atsu, says the Ghana footballer’s whereabouts still unknown — barely a day after he was reportedly rescued from the rubble of a building “with injuries” after the Turkey earthquakes. Atsu, who plays for Turkey’s Hatayspor, was declared missing after the tremor ravaged his home in the Kahramanmaras, the city where the club is based. On Tuesday, Mustafa Ozat, Hatayspor’s spokesperson, said the Ghanaian had been found alive but was injured. He added that the 31-year-old was undergoing medical treatment at an undisclosed hospital. However, in a tweet on Wednesday, Sechere said the family has not been able to locate Atsu since the report of his rescue was announced. Following yesterdays update from the club that, Christian had been pulled out alive, we are yet to confirm Christian’s whereabouts. As you can imagine, this continues to be a devastating time for his family and we are doing everything we can to locate Christian. pic.twitter.com/WKteG3l4cp — Nana Sechere (@iAmNana7) February 8, 2023  “Following yesterday’s update from the club that, Christian had been pulled out alive, we are yet to confirm Christian’s whereabouts,” he wrote. “As you can imagine, this continues to be a devastating time for his family and we are doing everything we can to locate Christian. “Official updates will be provided as more information comes to light. Please respect the family’s privacy during this harrowing time, and refrain from spreading unsubstantiated news as this will only hamper the search efforts for Christian.” There are also claims that the body discovered by the rescue team might not be Atsu’s. The death toll from the devastating earthquakes has surpassed 10,000. The tremors affected southern Turkey and northern Syria and most of the Mediterranean region.
