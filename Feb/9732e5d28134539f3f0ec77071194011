A hunter has reportedly found thousands of permanent voter cards (PVCs) in a forest in Nnewi area of Anambra state. In a now viral video, Amaka Nwafor, a reporter with Authority FM, said a hunter found the PVCs on Tuesday in a forest in Akamili, Nnewi north LGA of Anambra. She said the cards were in two bags and placed in a black drum, adding that upon discovery, the hunter took the PVCs to the premises of Authority FM. Nwafor said the PVCs checked so far belonged to persons in Nnewi north LGA. She, therefore, called on those who were told their PVCs could not be found to come to the radio station to look for their PVCs. Meanwhile, in a statement, Tochukwu Ikenga, the state police spokesperson, said the command has not received any such report. “Given the above, the Commissioner of Police, CP Echeng Echenghas, ordered investigations into the video to unravel the circumstances surrounding the incident and possibly arrest the suspects behind the act,” the statement reads. “Therefore, the command is constrained to make further comments and any  development in this regard shall be communicated.” Efforts to reach the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the reported PVCs were not successful at the time of this report. The development comes days to the presidential and national assembly elections. In the past months, there have been reports of PVCs found under the ground and in the possession of individuals. There have also been reports of PVCs found with foreign nationals.
