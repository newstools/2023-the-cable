Ghana’s Emos Korblah shot 68, one under par, to win the 54-hole Acutech Pro-Am Classic concluded at the Ikeja Golf Club, Lagos on Thursday. The N10 million total purse classic was the first time the club was staging a professional championship in 22 years as the event marked a new chapter in professional event hosting. Korblah, who has been a member of the professional golfers association for over a decade, described the Ikeja course as tricky. He added that it, however, brought the best out of him. “I think thanks should go to the sponsors and members of Ikeja Golf Club and the Acutech team for this event. I have fellow professionals Gift Willy and Oche Odoh to thank for this win for giving me a tough time,” Korblah said. Willy of Python Golf Club ended the game with four over par for the 54- hole play, one shot behind Korblah, while Odoh of IBB International Golf and Country Club finished in third place, totaling five over par. Zed Jituboh, chairman of the sponsoring company, said the golfers’ showcasing of skills was a delight. “Nigeria’s professional golfers are talented enough to rank among their peers globally but they are underrated and it is my desire that Acutech can inspire other stakeholders to invest in promoting the talent we have,” Jituboh, who was also inducted as a patron of the PGA of Nigeria during the closing ceremony, said. The PGA Championship and The Meristem were the first events of the year prior to the Acutech Pro-Am Classic.
