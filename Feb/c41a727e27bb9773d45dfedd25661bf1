The All Progressives Congress (APC) governors have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to allow both the old and new naira notes to co-exist to ease the suffering of Nigerians. Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna state, said the request was made to the president when the APC governors met with him on Friday. El-Rufai was flanked by Abdullahi Ganduje, Kano state governor, while briefing journalists on the outcome of the meeting at the state house. He said although the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) mopped up over N2 trillion of the old notes in circulation, only N300 billion worth of new notes were printed. The governor said if the CBN intends to implement the cashless policy, the apex bank should have printed at least half of what was mopped up. He said the governors told the president that the masses are suffering and traders are losing their goods due to a lack of patronage. El-Rufai said they appealed to Buhari to reconsider his stance. The Kaduna governor however said the president did not decline or approve the request. He said Atiku Bagudu, Kebbi state governor and chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum, is meeting with the president privately in a bid to convince him to shift ground on the matter.
