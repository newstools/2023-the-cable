Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has promised a permanent solution to the clashes between farmers and herders if he is elected. In a statement on Monday by Abdulaziz Abdulaziz, his media aide, Tinubu made the promise on Sunday while receiving leaders of Fulani communities under the aegis of the Fulbe United for Peace and Development (FUPD), in Abuja. “Prior to this day, I never thought I would meet a Fulani man who speaks better Yoruba. That is very wonderful,” he was quoted as saying. “This is the Nigeria that we want. We expect Nigeria to be united with one voice, sharing of culture and belief in each other. I want to tell you if we stay here for the next five hours, it’s the same story you would be hearing from me. Thank Almighty Allah. “We have had problems with herders. But I guarantee you today that the problem would be solved permanently. The blueprint is almost ready. We will plan with it. The world is fair and good for all of us. “We have to live in peace not only because of today but because of our children and grandchildren. “What we learn about the Fulanis is their simplicity and commitment to promises. When they give you commitment, you get it. I hope I can transfer the blood and spirit that I got from you to my grandchildren for the unity, stability, and peace of Nigeria. “You know you are in my heart. We will make Nigeria great. And we will make the name Fulani a very respectable name.” Ardo Bobboi, the group’s leader, said the FUPD will use its 33,661 members to mobilise millions of its members to vote for Tinubu in the presidential poll. The group also conferred on Tinubu the title of ‘Barkindo’ (the blessed one) which they described as a revered title among the Fulani extraction.
