Confirming the incident, Abdullahi Kiyawa, police spokesperson in the state, said election materials were removed from centre and the fire was extinguished. Kiyawa added that some suspects have been arrested over the development. “Attempts were made by some miscreants to burn down the place but the fire was put out and all the election materials were evacuated,” he added. “More so, three persons have been arrested and investigations are on.” Some officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) also sustained injuries during the attack. Speaking on the development at a media briefing, Kawu Samaila, the Kano south senatorial candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), alleged that one person was killed. “It so happened that one of the collation centres at Takai local government area was attacked today at about 10am. Some miscreants came with weapons and tried to disrupt the collation process,” Samaila said. “They beat up some officials at the collation centre. They shot at some of our supporters who were there waiting to witness the declaration of results. “Unfortunately, one is dead and the other is hospitalised at the moment.”
