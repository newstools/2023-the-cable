Some officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were reportedly injured during an accident involving an operational vehicle on Friday evening. The accident occurred at the Giri roundabout in Abuja. The officers were said to be on their way to Lagos on election duty. It was not immediately clear, how many officers of the agency were in the vehicle. A video shared by the NTA showed passersby picking up papers suspected to be electoral materials scattered on the ground. The items were being conveyed by the vehicle, as an eyewitness said some of the NSCDC personnel in the vehicle sustained ‘life-threatening injuries’. “I don’t know whether it’s a tyre that burst but I saw the accident. The people are at the back, they sustained wounds. The other person sustained a head wound so I don’t know if he would be able to survive,” the eyewitness said. “Some of the senior officers followed them to Gwagwalada. That’s what happened.” No fatalities have been reported so far. The highly-anticipated Nigerian presidential election holds today.
