The University of Jos (UNIJOS) on Wednesday organised a town hall meeting for governorship candidates in Plateau state ahead of the country’s general election. Speaking at the event, Tanko Ishaya, vice-chancellor of the institution, said the meeting was to give members of the university community and the public, a platform to interact with the candidates. Ishaya said the town hall meeting was organised in collaboration with the Hausa Service of the Voice of America (VOA). He said the initiative was part of the institution’s contribution toward peaceful and credible elections in the state and the country. “The university is the centre for any meaningful development in the society; a university is about the town and gown, not an isolated ivory tower,” he said. “Organising an event like this is important for the development of Plateau and Nigeria as a whole. “We are non-partisan and so what we are doing here today is purely an exercise to give the candidates an opportunity to tell Plateau what they have to offer if elected “It will also provide an opportunity for members of the university community and indeed Plateau citizens to probe the candidates and enable them to make a good choice.” Ishaya called on the various candidates to be peaceful and imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship as they go about their campaigns. “Let me remind all of you that you are brothers and friends, you should remain friends and brothers during and after the elections,” he added. NAN reports that the event was attended by Nentawe Yilwatda of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Caleb Mutfwang of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and Luka Pampe of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). Others include Sam Abashe of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Solomon Chendan of the African Democratic Party (ADP), and Ponyah Ibrahim of the  Social Democratic Party (SDP).
