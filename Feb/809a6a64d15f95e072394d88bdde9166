Some youths, who identified themselves as Kwankwasiyya supporters, on Thursday, paraded through the streets of Kano state with machetes and sticks. Kwankwasiyya supporters are persons backing Rabiu Kwankwaso, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). The youths were brandishing sticks and machetes, with some of them walking, and others riding in tricycles. The march was part of activities to welcome Kwankwaso to Kano, and the youths marched through Naibawa-Zaria road, Kofar Naisa, Dengi roundabout, Gyadi-Gyadi road, Zaria road, and Angwua uku-Zaria road. The development comes hours before the presidential election scheduled for Saturday. Meanwhile, presidential candidates had, on Wednesday, signed an accord to support peaceful elections, and abide by the results of the poll as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Although Kwankwaso has a huge following in Kano where he once served as governor, Abdullahi Ganduje of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is the current governor of the state. See photos below.
