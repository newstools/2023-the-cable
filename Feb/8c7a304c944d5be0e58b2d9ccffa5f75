The federal fire service says its personnel will be on standby to respond to fire incidents during and after the elections. Jaji Abdulganiyu, controller general, spoke on Wednesday during a brainstorming session with management staff on the elections. Abdulganiyu said it was necessary to ensure the safety of INEC infrastructure, officials, and the integrity of the electoral process. “We must ensure that our resources are properly allocated and be prepared to respond to any potential fire-related issues that may arise,” he said. “I am confident that with the hard work and dedication of my officers and men of the federal fire service, we will be able to ensure the safety of polling units, wards, local governments, and state collation centres, as well as providing a secure environment for citizens to cast their votes.” “As relevant stakeholders in the inter-agency consultative committee on election security (ICCES), ahead of the 2023 general election, the recent attacks on INEC Offices across the country places a burden on our shoulders as fire officers to ensure that this ugly situation is nipped in the bud.” The controller general said the service has put a comprehensive fire safety plan in place. He said the plan includes increased fire safety inspection, fire prevention, and protection measures, and increased presence of fire personnel in areas prone to fire outbreaks. “Fire personnel will be on standby to respond to any fire incidents that may occur during and after the election,” he said. “Fire safety education and awareness campaigns will also be conducted to ensure that citizens are well informed on fire safety measures and protocols, the federal fire service will work closely with local fire departments and other emergency services to ensure that all fire incidents are dealt with swiftly and effectively.”
