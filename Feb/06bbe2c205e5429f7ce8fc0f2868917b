The Osun government has advised the residents of the state to avoid the presidential campaign rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The APC has scheduled its presidential campaign rally in the state for Thursday. In a statement by Olawale Rasheed, the spokesperson to Ademola Adeleke, the governor of Osun, the state government said it has received credible reports that there could be an outbreak of violence at the rally. “Additionally, the State Governor further directed Osun indigenes to remain peaceful and calm while at the same time warning against any attempt to create conflict in the Osun Osun state,” the statement reads. “The APC has imported their agents of death. There is the likelihood they may engage in fights and brawls. It is important for our people to stay safe, away from the assemblage of evil hands.” Meanwhile, the state also said it has approved the use of the Osogbo stadium for the campaign rally. The state government said the stadium was approved to manage the tense security atmosphere in the state. “Consequently, the State Governor, Senator Ademola Adeleke, has directed the state police command and the Department of State Services to enforce state directives to ensure peace and tranquillity across the state,” the statement adds.
