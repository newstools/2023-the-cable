Manchester United came from a goal down to defeat Barcelona 2-1 in the second leg of their UEFA Europa League round-of-32 encounter played at Old Trafford on Thursday night. Fred and Antony scored two second-half goals to cancel Robert Lewandowski’s first-half penalty. Bruno Fernandes’ needless foul handed Barcelona a golden opportunity from the spot and Lewandowski scored the opener. The arrival of Antony as a halftime substitute, however, changed the course of the game as Fred hit the ball from the edge of the penalty area just two minutes into the second half before Antony secured victory with a goal on 73 minutes. The win gives Man United a 4-3 aggregate victory over the Spanish League leaders after a 2-2 scoreline in the first leg. The Red Devils also advanced to the next stage of the competition.
