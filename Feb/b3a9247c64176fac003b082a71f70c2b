The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says its operatives have arrested one Salman Umar Hudu, identified as an indigene of Kano, over alleged impersonation. In a statement from its media office on Tuesday, the EFCC said the suspect was arrested in Abuja for “falsely representing himself” as Abdulrasheed Bawa, the chairperson of the anti-graft agency. The commission also said the suspect obtained N100,000 from someone he promised to help “handle” any EFCC matter. “The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Tuesday, February 14, 2023, arrested one Salman Umar Hudu, a 38-year-old indigene of Kano, at a hotel in Abuja, for falsely representing himself as the Executive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, and other officers of the Commission, and obtaining N100,000.00 (One Hundred Thousand Naira) from a person he convinced that he can ‘handle’ any matter with the EFCC,” the statement reads. “The suspect has given useful information and will be charged to court upon conclusion of the investigation.” The development comes months after the EFCC arraigned one Adamu Jiyaba for allegedly impersonating a director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Meanwhile, in February 2020, the anti-graft agency arrested three suspects who impersonated Ibrahim Magu, former EFCC chairman.
