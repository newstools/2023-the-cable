Umar Madawaki, the governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Adamawa state, has asked his supporters to vote for Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Peter Obi is the LP presidential candidate. Speaking on Thursday at a media briefing, Madawaki accused the LP of “sidelining him and other party candidates”. “We have been deliberately disrespected by the party structure at the national and state levels,” he said. “It is in light of this that we entered into discussions with the APC and after exhaustive negotiations, we have resolved to collapse our entire structure for the APC and particularly, for the presidential election. “I, therefore, call on all my supporters to go to the polls on Saturday and overwhelmingly vote senator Bola Tinubu as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Madawaki, however, asked his supporters to vote for him during the governorship election. “My commitment is to run an administration that will embrace everyone regardless of ethnicity, location, and religion,” he said. “I will work committedly to build a state that is strong, rich, and safe for everyone.”
