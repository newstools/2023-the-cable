Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says if elected, he will develop the Calabar port to create abundant business opportunities. Abubakar said this on Monday while addressing a crowd of supporters at the PDP presidential rally held in Calabar, the state capital. He said expanding the port will attract commercial activities in the south-south, adding that roads connecting the state to other parts of the country will be part of his administration’s focus. “If you open up the Calabar port, it will create massive business and important opportunities for the people of Cross River state,” he said. “Another thing you should understand, the moment the Calabar port is expanded and is functional, it is going to be an attraction to factories and businesses and it will be to the benefit of the people of Cross River state. “This is just one. Again, agricultural potentials are going to be multiplied. So, developing Calabar port alone is going to be an abundant opportunity for the people of Cross River and I promise you, if you vote for PDP for the president and governorship, we will work together with your governor, your legislators. We will implement this policy which has been grounded by APC. “There is the issue of infrastructural development, that is first of all, the road networks connecting you with neighbouring states, and then secondly, the proposed rail line from Lagos through Calabar to Port Harcourt.”
