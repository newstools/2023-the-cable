The Akin Fadeyi Foundation has called on Nigerians to report cases of vote buying and electoral violence through FLAG’IT, its accountability tool. In a statement, the foundation said the application allows people to “record and report any form of electoral malpractices, vote buying, or selling and election violence, that is encountered”. Nigerians went to the polls on Saturday to elect President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor as well as the national assembly candidates. The election has recorded lapses such as delays, insecurity, and violence targeted at officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as well as voters in some parts of the country. In the statement, the foundation encouraged voters to download, sign up and use the app to report any electoral malpractices at their polling units. It also enjoined Nigerians to “shun violence, heated arguments and resort to using the FlagIt app to record incidents, rather than take laws into their own hands”. The foundation launched the mobile application through which Nigerians can report corrupt practices in October 2019. At the time, Fadeyi, executive director of the foundation, said the application was designed to enable the opening up of government institutions for transparency and accountability. “For every naira that is stolen, there is a negative impact on society. We are aware that the culture of corruption has become so endemic and difficult to tackle,” he had said. “If we must end it, we must start by talking to the man in the mirror and ask, ‘what is my role in defeating corruption and rebuilding the Nigerian nation of our dream.” Download the app here
