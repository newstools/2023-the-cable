Alhassan Doguwa, majority leader of the house of representatives, has been arrested by the police for his alleged role in attacks in Kano state during the general election. The Daily Trust reported that a source in the police said Doguwa was picked up on Tuesday at the Mallam Aminu Kano international airport while boarding a flight to Abuja. The source said the police received a report in Tudun Wada alleging that Doguwa led the thugs that set ablaze the secretariat of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in the area, with two persons feared dead. “He is currently cooling off in the state criminal investigation department,” the source was quoted as saying. Earlier on Tuesday at a media briefing, Doguwa denied the allegation that supporters of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), were responsible for the fire that gutted the secretariat of the NNPP in Tudun Wada LGA of the state. During the briefing, Doguwa also said he learnt that the police were looking for him but said he had not received any formal invitation. “I never held a gun. I don’t even know how to hold a gun. I also never held any weapon throughout the election,” he had said.
