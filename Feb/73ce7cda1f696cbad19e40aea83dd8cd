Muhammad Garba, the commissioner for information in Kano, says banks in the state did not get any allocation of new naira notes from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the last four days. In a statement on Friday, Garba said Abdullahi Ganduje, the governor of Kano, said the naira redesign has caused “unnecessary hardship” for residents of the state. He said the implementation of the cashless policy has affected businesses in the state and accused the CBN of “prejudice”. “The state government said that given the daily volume of trade in the North’s commercial nerve centre, the CBN is starving commercial banks of the money supposed to be allocated to them,” the statement reads. “The CBN, as an agency of the Federal Government, has from all indications been reduced to a tool to settle political scores by choosing a wrong time to force a policy on the people that could have been implemented at the appropriate time in the past. “The general populace in the state has been subjected to unnecessary hardship by depriving them access to their hard-earned money, ostensibly to precipitate civil unrest that could lead to the postponement of the most awaited general election scheduled for next week. “The people of Kano, who are known for their peace-loving posture even in the face of provocation, have endured the hardship.” He advised residents to remain calm, and also urged them not to be discouraged about voting during the general election.
