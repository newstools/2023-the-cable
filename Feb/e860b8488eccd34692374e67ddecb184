Gunmen have attacked a section at the headquarters of Okehi LGA in Kogi state. The attack was said to have occurred on Monday night. A resident in the area told TheCable on Tuesday morning that the treasurerâ€™s office in the complex was attacked with explosives. The LG headquarters is a few metres away from the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the area. The source said while there is no casualty recorded in the attack, locals believed that the attackers were targeting to destroy some documents in the office. William Aya, public relations officer of the police (PPRO) in Kogi, was not immediately available to comment on the attack. He did not respond to calls and text messages put through to his mobile phone for comments. The development comes less than two months after an explosion rocked a community in Okene LGA of the state. The incident happened at a mosque near the palace of Ado Ibrahim, the paramount ruler of Ebiraland, on the day President Muhammadu Buhari visited the area to inaugurate projects completed by the state government.
