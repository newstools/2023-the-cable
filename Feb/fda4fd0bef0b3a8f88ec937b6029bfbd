The National Population Commission (NPC) says it has captured everywhere in the country for the conduct of the census. Nasiru Kwarra, chairperson of the commission, said this on Thursday at the inauguration of the population and housing national census publicity committee in Abuja. The commission had fixed March 29 to April 2 for the conduct of the 2023 census. Kwara said the commission deployed its staff to areas facing security challenges, such as the Sambisa forest, for capturing. The Sambisa forest is said to be a major abode for insurgents, with several military operations targeted at the area. Speaking further, Kwarra assured Nigerians that the census will hold as planned, adding that everywhere including villages have been captured for the exercise. “There is no place we have not visited. Our staff even went as far as Sambisa Forest where we have security challenges. So, I assure you that no one will be left out in the entire census process,” he said. “And all structures have been captured, and geo-coded. Your house in the village has been captured and geo-coded. This aspiration has informed the methodology and quality of preparations for the census in the last few years. “In all these, the need for advocacy, publicity, and public enlightenment cannot be overemphasised.” On Tuesday, the federal government inaugurated a security committee to ensure credible and peaceful conduct of the census.
