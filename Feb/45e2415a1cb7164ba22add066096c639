Manchester United defeated Newcastle United 2-0 to win the Carabao Cup on Sunday at Wembley Stadium. The first-half header by Casemiro and Sven Botman’s own goal set the Red Devils on their way to their first silverware since the 2016-17 season. Despite Newcastle dominating the early exchanges, Casemiro rose highest to plant a header from Luke Shaw’s free-kick into the bottom corner on 33 minutes before Marcus Rashford’s strike was deflected into the net by Botman on 39 minutes. Newcastle improved in the second half but Man United stayed resolute to claim a well-deserved victory. The latest Carabao Cup triumph is United’s first trophy since also winning the same tournament in 2017. United have now won six Carabao Cup titles in the club’s history. The trophy is also Erik Ten Hag’s first silverware as Man United manager, coming in his first season at the club.
