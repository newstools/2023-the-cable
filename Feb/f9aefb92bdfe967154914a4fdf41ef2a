The federal government has ordered the closure of all land borders ahead of the general election. The presidential and national assembly elections have been fixed for February 25. In a statement on Thursday by Tony Akuneme, spokesperson of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Isah Jere, the NIS comptroller-general, said the border closure will last for 24 hours on election day. The closure will be effective from 12am on Saturday to 12am on Sunday. “Accordingly, all command comptrollers especially those in the border states are to ensure strict enforcement of this directive,” he added. The development comes hours after Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police (IGP), ordered the restriction of vehicular movement across the country on election day. The restriction, which exempts persons on essential duties, will be effective from midnight on Friday till 6pm on Saturday. Those on essential services are officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), electoral observers, persons responding to medical emergencies, firefighters, among others.
