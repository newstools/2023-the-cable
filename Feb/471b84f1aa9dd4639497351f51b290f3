Timi Frank, a former deputy spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says President Muhammadu Buhari should not take counsel seeking to shift the forthcoming elections. In January, the federal government ruled out the possibility of postponing the elections. In a statement on Sunday, Frank, who is the ambassador of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) for East Africa and the middle east, said a shift in the poll would only add to the horrendous experience that Nigerians are currently passing through. The former deputy spokesperson of the ruling party said Buhari should fulfil his promise of ensuring that the polls are free, fair and credible. “Buhari has promised Nigerians and the world to bequeath free, fair and credible as his legacy. He must not allow the APC governors and the behest of Tinubu to sway him to do otherwise,” Frank said. “You need to prove Tinubu wrong that your government has not failed by making sure the forthcoming general election is free, fair and credible. “The international community is waiting to see if you will keep to your promise or you deceived them with your promise to ensure holistic electoral reforms in the country. “Nigerians are ready to go to the polls to correct the evil policies of an uncaring administration as Tinubu has confirmed in order to free themselves from hardship deliberately inflicted on them through clueless leadership. “This is a better time to hold this election to enable Nigerians to choose whether to remain in Egypt with APC’s Pharaoh or to cross over to the promised land with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).”
