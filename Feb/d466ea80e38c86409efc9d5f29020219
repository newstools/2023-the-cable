Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, has granted permission to fuel stations to commence 24-hour operations across the state. Sanwo-Olu announced the decision on Wednesday while addressing journalists at the state house, Marina. Last month, the Lagos government had restricted the operating hours of filling stations on major highways in the state. The decision was meant to ease traffic caused by queues at filling stations across the state. Speaking at the news conference, Sanwo-Olu said the restriction had been lifted and that fuel stations could now operate throughout the day. He said the action was one of several steps taken to mitigate the impact of the lingering petrol shortage at the federal level, which has had a significant impact on the state. “We have taken some steps to cushion the effects of these measures that were announced at the federal level but with telling effects on states,” he said. “There have been talks between the state government and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited (NNPCL) on the lingering fuel shortage. “NNPCL demanded Ijegun Egba tank owners and operators unhindered access to the tank farms where about 40 percent of petroleum products come from. “We have been able to do that by rearranging the timing of the work on the Buba Marwa Road, the dual carriageway that leads to the tank farms. The road is over 50 percent completed. Now, you would have noticed some improvement in the supply of petroleum products. “Also, we have given approval for 24-hour work at petrol stations around the state.” The governor also announced measures to help alleviate the effects of the cash scarcity in the country. One of such is the 50 percent reduction of fares on all state-owned transportation services.
