Kelechi Iheanacho was the star of the occasion as Leicester City came from a goal down to trash Tottenham 4-1 in their English Premier League (EPL) clash at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. The 26-year-old scored one and assisted another as Leicester dented Tottenham’s push for a top-four place in the league. After Nampalys Mendy’s bullet shot from distance had cancelled Rodrigo Bentancur’s opener, Iheanacho gave Leicester the lead by serving the ball on a plate for James Madisson to slot in for 2-1. The Super Eagles forward made it 3-1 before the interval with a well-taken goal, carrying the ball to the edge of the area before planting a low strike into the far bottom corner. The goal was Iheanacho’s third in as many matches, while the former Manchester City youngster has also contributed two goals and three assists for Leicester in February. Harvey Barnes completed the thrashing with a similar effort as Leicester’s revival continued. The Foxes are now up to 13th place on the log with 24 points from 22 matches. Elsewhere, Arsenal stumbled in their title push following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Brentford at the Emirates Stadium. Leandro Trossard scored his first Arsenal goal to hand the Gunners a lead they eventually surrendered, no thanks to Ivan Toney’s strike. Mikel Arteta’s team now has 51 points from 21 matches, six more than second-placed Man City.
