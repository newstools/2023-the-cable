The Rivers police command has arrested Chinyere Igwe, a member of the house of representatives, with $498,100 cash. Igwe is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmaker representing Port Harcourt II federal constituency. He is a supporter of Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the PDP. Grace Iringe-Koko, the Rivers police spokesperson, said the lawmaker was also apprehended with a list for the distribution of the money. “Police officers from Rivers state command deployed to INEC headquarters, Aba road today 24/2/2023 at about 0245hrs, while on stop and search, arrested one honourable Chinyere Igwe, member house of representatives representing Port Harcourt II federal constituency with a cash sum of $498,100 inside a bag in his car,” the police spokesperson wrote in a statement. “Also recovered was a list for distribution of the money.” Iringe-Koko said Abutu Yaro, assistant inspector-general (elections) has ordered “swift interrogation” of the lawmaker and subsequent arraignment in court. The police asked all candidates and political parties to “comply strictly” with provisions of the 2022 Electoral Act and other laws guiding elections. The development comes less than 24 hours to the presidential and national assembly elections. Igwe is a supporter of Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the PDP. In August 2022, the Rivers state government said it would prosecute the lawmaker over alleged involvement in oil bunkering. Weeks later, his filling station in the state was sealed off over allegations of “involvement in “criminal activities”.
