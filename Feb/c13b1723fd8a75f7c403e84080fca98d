Seyi Makinde, governor of Oyo, says the people of the state will vote for a presidential candidate who will promote equity, justice, and unity. The governor spoke on Thursday when he received Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Ibadan, the state capital. The APC held its presidential campaign rally in Oyo on Thursday. He asked Tinubu to feel free to campaign in the state, saying everything has been done to ensure the event is peaceful and hitch-free. He said his administration believes in putting people first, and that “political players will come and go, but the country will remain”. Speaking on the position of the G5 governors, Makinde said “if we have to choose between the unity of this country and our political aspirations, we will choose the unity of this country”. “If we have to move forward as a people, we have to involve a system such that there is inclusivity, there’s fairness, there’s justice, there’s equity in how we run this country,” he said. “There are different political parties, different players, but if the country does not survive, the political parties will fade away. “There has to be inclusiveness by all sections of the country in power-sharing if the country must progress. If the country does not survive, how can anyone aspire to be anything in that country? “I wish you well. It’s only a couple of days to the election, but one thing I want you to take away from this is the fact that we will vote for equity, for fairness, for justice, and unity.” In his remarks, the APC presidential candidate thanked Makinde for the warm reception, saying he came to accord him the respect that he deserves as the chief executive of the state. “I cannot come to Oyo state to campaign for votes without visiting you to pay my respect to you as a governor, leader, and an Omoluabi.”
