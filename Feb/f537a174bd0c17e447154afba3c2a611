The Obi-Datti campaign team has dismissed a viral “petition” alleging that Peter Obi, the Labour Party’s presidential candidate, gave N2 billion to churches in the country. According to the petition making the rounds on social media platforms, one Frank Onwumere, said to be a senior pastor at the “Dominion Centre International” in Okigwe, Imo state, queried the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on how the said fund was disbursed among churches. The fund was said to have been gifted “to help and assist in mobilising and convincing their congregation to vote massively for the candidacy of Mr. Peter Obi”. However, in a statement by its media office on Sunday, the campaign team said the petition was “concocted to tarnish the hard-earned reputation” of the party’s presidential candidate. The party, while describing the said petition as “blackmail stuff”, also asked the public to disregard the petition. “Our mission in the Obidient Movement this day is to alert and warn discerning minds, especially those desirous to see a new Nigeria emerge through Peter Obi, to ignore and treat as thrash any doctored and faked items on Obi,” the statement reads. “Anything they are bringing now after their long fruitless search is concocted to tarnish the hard-earned reputation of the candidate and should be disregarded. “Obi-Datti Media is proud to insist that the LP standard bearer and his running mate remain the best product in the market for the much-needed political leadership in the country at this time, and to state without any fear of contradiction that they stand out untainted and possess the prerequisite qualities needed to rescue this troubled land. “The public should therefore have their eyes permanently glued to the ball and refuse to be distracted by any antics because all the devious acts will give way to reason and justice and Nigeria will be successfully taken back from them and reset for greatness.”
