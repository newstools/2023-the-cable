Military sources told Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency publication focused on the Lake Chad region, that the terrorists advanced toward Gamboru from various locations to penetrate into the town on Wednesday morning. The sources said the “troopers overwhelmed the insurgents with superior firepower”. Zagazola did not state the number of casualties suffered by the insurgents. ”Troops of 3 Battalion on operation Hadin Kai had successfully repelled ISWAP’s attack at Gamboru Ngala, Borno State early this morning,” the source was quoted as saying. “Some of the terrorists were neutralised during the encounter while other members of the group fled following a superior firepower from the troops.” TheCable had also reported how troops of the 27 task force brigade of Operation Hadin Kai have reportedly killed many ISWAP terrorists in Yobe.
