Former President Olusegun Obasanjo says he’s hopeful that nothing will “intervene against” the upcoming elections. Obasanjo spoke on Wednesday when he received a delegation of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) board of trustees (BoT) in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital. He highlighted concerns by Nigerians that the election might be postponed due to the hardship and protests created by the naira and fuel scarcity. He said the global community, especially West Africa, has a keen interest in Nigeria’s election, and so Nigerians should be more concerned. “We are in an interesting period in Nigeria. In less than three weeks, we will be going to the polls,” he said. “Well, I hope nothing will intervene against that. In less than three weeks, we will be electing a leader that will pilot the affairs of Nigeria for the next four years from May. “And all of us in Nigeria, again, as I have said to you, early this morning, I have been in Togo, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire from the beginning of the week, from Sunday and they are as concerned about what happens in Nigeria as every Nigerian should be. “Last night before I left Abidjan, President Ouattara (Alassane) was telling me the position in West Africa that Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire are vying for and he said to me, well we are putting it on hold until after Nigeria’s election. “So even for them, Nigeria’s election is of importance. And I believe that for us who are directly involved, we cannot be any less important than those people. “Your party (ADC) is one of the significant parties in existence in this country and no matter the amplitude, your voice matters.”
