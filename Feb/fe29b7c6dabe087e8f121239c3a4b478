The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has suspended the Enugu east senatorial election over the death of Oyibo Chukwu, the Labour Party’s candidate. Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairperson, announced the development on Friday during a media briefing at the national collation centre in Abuja. Chukwu was killed and set ablaze at Amechi Awkunanaw in Enugu south LGA on Wednesday after gunmen opened fire on his convoy. Speaking on Friday, Yakubu said the senatorial election for Enugu east district will now hold on March 11, 2023. “The party conveyed its intention to participate in the election for that constituency by replacing its deceased candidate. This request is in line with the provision of the law, section 34(1) of the Electoral Act, 2022,” he said. “The Labour Party has provided satisfactory evidence of the death of its candidate. Consequently, the commission has suspended the election in the senatorial district as provided by law. “We have already communicated this decision to our Enugu state office. “Therefore, there will be no senatorial election in Enugu east senatorial district made up of six local government areas, 77 wards, and 1,630 polling units tomorrow, February 25, 2023. “The election will now be combined with the governorship and state assemblies’ elections holding in the next two weeks — on 11th of March, 2023.”
