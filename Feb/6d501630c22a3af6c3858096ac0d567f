Wole Soyinka, playwright and Nobel laureate, says the viral social media post which claimed he endorsed Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is not from him. The social media post also claimed the playwright called former President Olusegun Obasanjo a liar and Atiku Abubakar, the former vice-president, a corrupt politician. “Quote me anywhere, Nigerians don’t need the likes of Atiku and Obasanjo to lead them again. We have tasted the two: Atiku is corrupt and Obasanjo is a liar. Both of them are greedy and self-centered,” the social media post read in part. “Anybody, any cabal, any Viju milk activist, attempting to humiliate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu must have me to contend with. An average PDP man is angry with Asiwaju because he brought them to their knees.” But in a statement, on Sunday, Soyinka said he never made the comments at any time. “Professor Soyinka did NOT at any time or on any occasion issue such a statement. It is simply the work of peddlers of fake news and falsehood, who profit from misinformation to gain political advantages,” the playwright said. “The media and members of the public are advised to ignore the message or any other political message that addresses or targets any political party or political actor.”
