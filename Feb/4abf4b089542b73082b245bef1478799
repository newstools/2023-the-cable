Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Wednesday, briefed the federal executive council (FEC) on the plans for the elections. The FEC meeting was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. Mahmood briefed the council about the measures in place for the elections and how the challenges of naira and petrol scarcity are being addressed. “We had a meeting with the National Union of Road Transport Workers and they raised that as an issue of concern,” he said. “Immediately after that meeting, we interfaced with the leadership of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) and right now there’s a technical community working. “The idea is for them to avail use the use of their over 900 land mega stations as well as floating mega stations nationwide for the purpose of stocking products to ensure that the commission doesn’t suffer any encumbrances in the movement of personnel and materials for the elections. “The second one is the currency issue. Again, we had an engagement yesterday with the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. And he assured us that the commission will not suffer any encumbrances on that score. Fortunately for us, all our accounts, national and state are with the apex bank.” Before Yakubu briefed the council members, a minute silence was observed in honour of Dan Suleiman, former minister of special duties under the administration of Yakubu Gowon, former military head of state. Also expected to brief the council is Alkali Baba, the inspector general of police.
