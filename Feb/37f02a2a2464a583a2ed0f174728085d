The police command in Anambra state says gunmen attacked its station in Ogidi, Idemili north LGA, during the wee hours of Saturday. According to Ikenga Tochukwu, the police spokesperson in Anambra, the gunmen attacked the station and killed three police officers in the process. “It wasn’t a bomb explosion, it was an attack by unknown gunmen and it resulted in the death of three of our officers,” he told TheCable. “The hoodlums started shooting sporadically on approaching the area command and threw IEDs and petrol bombs, gaining entrance. Unfortunately, the buildings in the police facility were affected.” Meanwhile, this isn’t the first time that police stations have been attacked in the state. On December 28, 2022,  gunmen attacked the police divisional headquarters in the Ihiala area of the state with explosives. In June, TheCable reported that the police divisional headquarters in Anaku, Anyamelum was attacked by gunmen. While there were no fatalities in that particular attack, it was confirmed that three operational vehicles in the premises were set on fire. Two months prior, gunmen attacked a police checkpoint in Aguata LGA, three officers sustained injuries in the attack.
