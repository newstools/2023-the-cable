Some supporters of Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), have narrated how they were attacked by hoodlums in Lagos. Earlier on Saturday, TheCable had reported that Obi’s supporters were attacked while on their way to Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS), the venue of the party’s presidential campaign rally in the state. Some persons sustained injuries, while vehicles were also destroyed. Reacting to the incident, Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, said the state criminal investigation department will investigate the matter and arrest the attackers. Speaking with journalists, a member of the Obidient movement who identified himself as Oluwatoyin said someone was also stabbed. “It seems APC are not happy with what we are doing today. They attacked us in Ajah and other parts of Eti-Osa LGA,” he said. “They damaged our cars and injured many of us. A guy was just rushed to that place for treatment because he was stabbed by hoodlums.” Another victim, who had machete cut on his body, said the hoodlums who attacked supporters at Jakande area came in two buses. He added that the hoodlums fled after police officers arrived at the scene. “We had a plan to move a convoy from Jakande to TBS. So, what we did was to arrange a truck, DJ, and a convoy of cars,” the LP supporter said. “When we got to Jakande to make a U-turn and wait for other people to come, two buses loaded with guys came. “They came down from the buses holding machetes and guns and they started attacking us. They scattered the cars and beat some people. “To save my life, I laid at the Lekki-Epe expressway to obstruct traffic so that they won’t kill me.”
