President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, joined the presidential campaign rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo state. Speaking at the rally, Bola Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate, said if elected, he will address insecurity and advance Buhari’s legacies, including in the areas of infrastructure and agriculture. “You know the president with honesty, integrity and dependability. We will continue with his incorruptible and straightforward attributes,” Tinubu added. “We will strengthen and promote peace and unity in the state and confront violence and man inhumanity to fellow man, as that is the only way growth and development can be achieved.” Prior to the rally, the president was honoured by the state traditional council with the chieftaincy title of ‘Nwanne Di Na Mba’ (a brother in diaspora). In a statement by Femi Adesina, the presidential spokesperson, Buhari appreciated the council for the honour and assured them that he will continue to demonstrate his love for the south-east. “I thank you so much for this honour that I will continue to remember for the rest of my life. Thank you for getting all the senior citizens to receive us,” he said. “We have experienced difficult times as a country and discovered that it is better to carry on together.” Speaking at the rally, Buhari expressed confidence in Tinubu’s abilities to lead the country.
