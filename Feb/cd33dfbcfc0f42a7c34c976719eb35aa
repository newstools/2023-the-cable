Zenith Bank has temporarily shut down some of its branches in some states in Nigeria due to insecurity, TheCable understands. A source told TheCable on Friday that the bank’s management decided to close branches where the lives of staff members are being threatened by citizens who are seeking to withdraw cash. Commercial banks, including Zenith, have been at the receiving end of the rancour spreading across Nigeria following the scarcity of the new naira notes. A video seen on social media showed angry citizens damaging facilities at a Lagos branch of Zenith bank in order to gain access for ‘cash withdrawals’. In another video, some Nigerians alleged to be the bank’s staff members were seen fleeing through the back fence as customers besieged the gate of one of Zenith’s branches to get cash.

Other locations where some branches have shut down in the state include Egbeda, Costain, Awolowo Way, and Ogba, Ikeja. Another branch in Uyo, the capital of Akwa Ibom state, was also closed. Further speaking on the issue, the source also debunked claims that Zenith Bank has closed its branches nationwide. “That is not true. Branches were closed for security purposes. It is not a nationwide action,” the source said. “Wherever we notice that the lives of our staff are being threatened, we closed such branch temporarily. “Customers can also use the bank app to carry out other forms of transactions.”
