The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says train operations would be suspended from Saturday to Monday. Yakubu Mahmood, NRC spokesperson, announced the development in a statement on Tuesday. Mahmood said the suspension is part of efforts to ensure that Nigerians exercise their franchise at the presidential and national assembly elections scheduled for February 25. Train services affected include Abuja-Kaduna, Warri-Itakpe, Lagos-Ibadan, as well as the Iddo, Lagos-Ijoko interstate mass transit service. According to NAN, Yakubu added that normal train services would resume on February 28.
