Masai Ujiri, co-founder of the non-governmental organisation Giants of Africa, on Thursday, announced events to mark its 20th anniversary. Founded in 2003, the NGO has travelled throughout Africa conducting basketball camps for boys and girls, building courts, and facilitating youth outreach initiatives. “There is much to be proud of as we reflect on the last two decades,” said Ujiri, the vice-chairman and president of the Toronto Raptors. “Our passion and commitment have made us what we are today. We are excited about the bright future as we continue to develop infrastructure and inspire African youth worldwide with programmes focused on education, empowerment and leadership on and off the court.” Since its inception, Giants of Africa has impacted over 40,000 African youth across 17 countries through access to over 30 basketball courts and 80 basketball camps or clinics. Twenty-six of the courts were made possible through ‘Built Within’, the foundation’s multi-year, 100-court commitment to investing in sports infrastructure across Africa. Hundreds of Giants of Africa alumni have also received scholarships abroad. They include NBA player Precious Achiuwa of the Toronto Raptors and WWE star Tolupe Omogbehin.
