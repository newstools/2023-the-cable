The ministry of sports development and youth has announced that the first-ever national cross-country championship will be held in Jos on February 18. Cross-country championship is an outdoor race run over a course made of natural terrain which can include grass, mud, gravel or hill. In a statement on Sunday, Sunday Dare, minister of sports, said the establishment of the national competition is necessary to develop Nigeria’s talent of long-distance runners. He added that Nigeria has “enormous potential to rival the east Africans” and can dominate the category of races. “Cross-country running, experts tell us is excellent for developing strength,” Dare said. “We have enormous potential to rival the east Africans and win laurels for the country at continental and international championships and games. More importantly, we want to positively engage the mass of distance runners in this country and make them earn a good living from running around the world like their east and north African counterparts.” On his part, Tony Osheku, the project coordinator, said the hardship faced by the athletes during the race will toughen them and provide lessons for future long-distance racing events. “In cross-country, you sometimes do a jump or run up a hill, and you’re not sure if you’re going to stumble. Or maybe you’ve picked up a lot of mud on your shoes and they feel as heavy as rocks,” Osheku said. “Either way, you’re building enormous strength: The hills and mud develop power and resilience in your calves, hamstrings, and quads. The uneven ground strengthens your feet and ankles.” The national cross-country championship is a 10-kilometre event and will be held at the Rhino Golf course in Jos.
