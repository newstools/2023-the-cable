Ademola Adeleke says he has confidence in the judiciary that he would retain his seat as the governor of Osun state. The Osun governorship election petition tribunal had, in January, sacked Adeleke as governor of the state. The tribunal had ruled in favour of the petition filed by Gboyega Oyetola and the All Progressives Congress (APC) that there was over-voting in some LGAs. Speaking on the tribunal’s ruling at the time, Adeleke rejected the verdict, calling it “a miscarriage of justice”. In a statement on Friday by Rasheed Olawale, his spokesperson, Adeleke said he believes in the role of the judiciary on strengthening democracy. “Democracy revolves around the wheel of justice. Justice dispensation is the realm of the judiciary,” he said. “All democrats must therefore have unshaken faith in the judiciary. I have that trust and confidence in the judiciary to right the wrong and deepen our democracy. “I am a beneficiary of judicial intervention. I cannot forget how the judiciary cleared me of forgery allegations. “You can’t have a strong democracy unless we all hold the judiciary as the indispensable arbiter. “So, we are going on appeal and we trust we are going to get justice. I urge all of us to be calm and go about our daily activities peacefully. “I understand how hard and emotional the judgment is to the people of Osun state, but we must vent our disagreement only through the judicial process. “That is why there is an appeal process. We have all the grounds to appeal and we are doing that. So, continue your campaign unit to unit. We are running Osun state to deliver on the will and aspirations of the people. “By God and man, our mandate will be revalidated through the same judicial process.”
