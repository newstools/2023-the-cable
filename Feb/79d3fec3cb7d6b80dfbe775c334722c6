The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has lost two more seats in the house of representatives to the Labour Party (LP) in Enugu and Abia states. While Chidi Obetta was declared the winner of the Nsukka/Igbo-Eze south federal constituency election in Enugu state, Ginger Onwusibe secured victory in Isiala Ngwa north/south federal constituency. Romanus Eze, returning officer of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), announced the result for Nsukka/Igbo-Eze on Sunday at the commission’s office in Nsukka. Eze said Obetta polled a total of 50,881 votes to defeat Vita Abba of the PDP, who polled 19,347 votes. Obetta was an aspirant for the seat on the PDP platform in May 2022, before he defected to the LP. Meanwhile, Patrick Asadu currently represents the constituency on the PDP platform but lost his bid to return to the house for a fifth term, to Abba. In another development, Ginger Onwusibe has been declared the winner of the Isiala Ngwa north/south federal constituency in Abia state. Onwusibe was also a PDP member before he defected to LP. Darlington Nwokocha won the election to represent Isiala Ngwa north/south federal constituency on the PDP platform in 2019, but for the 2023 elections, he secured the senatorial ticket of the LP to represent Abia central senatorial district. Nwokocha was also declared the winner of the election on Sunday. Earlier on Sunday, LP’s Donatus Mathew was declared the winner of the Kaura federal constituency seat in Kaduna state. Mathew defeated Gideon Gwani of the PDP, who presently represents the constituency and was seeking to occupy the seat for the fifth time.
