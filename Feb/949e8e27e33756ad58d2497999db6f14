Mamman Dauda, the commissioner of police in Plateau state, says two suspects were arrested in the state for allegedly snatching Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) during the presidential and national assembly elections. NAN reports that Dauda, who is also in charge of election security spoke on Sunday. The commissioner said that the suspects were arrested in the Riyom local government area of the state by men of the special task force, Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), and were handed over to the police for further investigation. “The suspects are currently in the Criminal Investigation Departments (CID); we have commenced an investigation into the matter,” he said. Dauda said the election was generally peaceful in the state, except for a few disagreements which were resolved without much rancor. He commended the security personnel for their professional conduct during the poll, adding that the police had not received complaints of misconduct from the public. He also lauded the efforts of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for responding swiftly to some of the challenges encountered during the poll. The commissioner, who also thanked the residents of the state for supporting and cooperating with the security agencies toward ensuring a peaceful, free, fair, and credible poll, urged them to be peaceful even as results were being collated at various centres across the state.
