Emmanuel Bwacha, senator representing Taraba south, has been declared winner of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary rerun in Taraba state. Tukur Buratai, former chief of army staff and APC member, chaired the electoral committee. BACKGROUND The supreme court had, on February 1, nullified Bwachaâ€™s nomination as the governorship candidate of the APC in Taraba state. In its judgment, a five-member panel led by Kudirat Kekere-Ekun affirmed the verdict of a federal high court which held that the APC did not conduct a valid governorship primary in the state. The apex court also affirmed the judgment of the federal high court in Jalingo, the Taraba capital, which also required the party to conduct a fresh primary within 14 days. BWACHA WINS PRIMARY RERUN In the result announced on Friday after the conclusion of voting, Bwacha scored 778 votes, while Yusuf Yusuf, another aspirant, came second with five votes. Buratai said 840 delegates were expected at the election, out of which 796 were accredited. Speaking on his victory, Bwacha described the result as a confirmation that the people of the state were supporting his move to ensure good governance.
