Paul Onuachu, Super Eagles striker, has completed his transfer from Belgium’s KRC Genk to Southampton FC. The Saints announced the deal in a statement issued on Wednesday. The Nigerian penned a three-and-half-year contract that will see him play at St. Mary till 2026. The move, however, is still subject to work permit clearance. “Southampton Football Club is delighted to announce it has completed the signing of striker Paul Onuachu from Belgian club KRC Genk, subject to a work permit and international clearance,” the statement reads. “The 28-year-old joins from the Jupiler Pro League leaders on a contract until 2026, becoming the fifth signing of the month for Nathan Jones’s squad, after the transfers of Mislav Oršić, Charly Alcaraz and James Bree, as well as fellow deadline-day arrival Kamaldeen Sulemana. “Nigeria international Onuachu has been in magnificent form for Genk this season, with the 6ft 7in forward netting 17 goals in 22 appearances, making him the top scorer in the Belgian top-flight.” According to The Athletic, Southampton splashed out close to €21 million for the signature of the 28-year-old Nigerian. Onuachu has been in top form for Genk since joining the club from FC Midtjylland in 2019. He won the Belgian league’s golden boot and player of the year in 2021.
