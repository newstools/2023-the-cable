Google has launched an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called Bard. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, said in a blog post that Bard is an experimental conversational AI service powered by Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA). Pichai said Bard will be open to “trusted testers” before making it more widely available to the public in the coming weeks. “Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world’s knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses,” Pichai said. “Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity, helping you to explain new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or learn more about the best strikers in football right 1now, and then get drills to build your skills.” Bard — which is said to be a rival of Microsoft-backed AI ChatGPT — intends to bring its latest AI advancements into various products, starting with Search. “Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” Pichai added. The company, however, said it will need rigorous testing and ensure to scale more users, “allowing for more feedback”. “We’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information,” the company said.
