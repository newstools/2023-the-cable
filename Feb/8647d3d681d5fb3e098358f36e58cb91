The Network of Incubators and Innovators in Nigeria (NINE) with the support of the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos has launched a tree-planting campaign in the state. One hundred trees would be planted under the campaign in some schools and communities in the state. The initiative, in collaboration with the Kids Beach Garden (KBG), aims to reduce erosion, mitigate climate impacts and increase awareness of the importance of nature-based solutions to climate change. Twenty trees have been planted at the Kids Beach Garden, Lagos, while the remaining 80 would be planted in four primary schools in Lekki, Epe, and Ajah communities between February 20 and 24. The trees would be monitored for over six months to ensure that they were not damaged. In a statement by the British High Commission, Ben Llewellyn-Jones, deputy high commissioner, said in addition to protecting existing trees and biodiversity, strategic tree planting is one of the most important ways to contribute to a greener and cleaner world. “Trees and forests play an important role in ensuring we have a healthy planet, prevent pollution, and mitigate the impacts of climate change,” Llewellyn-Jones said. “By re-introducing nature and ecosystems into built-up areas, we believe that this project will benefit the residents of Lagos state and the general Nigerian population.” Bankole Oloruntoba, chairperson of NINE, said the impact of climate change is felt daily across the world. “In addition to the collective global effort to mitigate the effects of climate change, we have brought the innovation community to do and tell when it comes to climate change,” Oloruntoba said. “We are happy to see the interest and participation from all stakeholders in the ecosystem and the efforts to share more messages about climate change.”
