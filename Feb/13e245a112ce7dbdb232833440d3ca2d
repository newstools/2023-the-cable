The Natives, a civil society organisation (CSO), says the political parties threatening to boycott the general election over the use of old naira notes are “insensitive”. On Monday, Kenneth Udeze, national chairman of Action Alliance (AA), said 14 out of the 18 registered political parties would boycott the polls if the deadline for the old naira notes is extended by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Kenneth spoke at a press conference by the Forum of Chairmen of Nigerian Political Parties. In a statement on Wednesday, Smart Edwards, president-general of The Natives, said no grassroots political party would support a policy that is inflicting hardship on Nigerians. “Nigerians are fighting in the banks, attacking themselves on the queues, throwing stones at public buildings, petty traders and commuters are frustrated yet platforms seeking people’s votes are making insensitive statements as regards general elections when citizens are grieving,” Edwards said. “We make bold to say these political parties are simply insensitive and lack grassroots empathy. “The citizens who are groaning under the redesigned naira policy do not know whether these insensitive political robbers exist on the ballot papers. “If they cannot see the pain the entire country is experiencing through the ill motivated sabotage of people’s livelihoods either by the banks, printers or providers of the money, then the relevance of these political parties should be questioned.” The president-general praised the All Progressives Congress (APC) governors who met with the president over the scarcity of the naira. “This is how to govern, when factoring how poorly managed the intention was by CBN, the outcry and a search for a solution within seven days is applauded, so we would welcome a resolution by the Supreme Court against this 13-party comedy,” he said.
