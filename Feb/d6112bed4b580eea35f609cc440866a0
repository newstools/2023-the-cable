The Albino Foundation Africa (TAF Africa) Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) Election Hub, says there was not enough voting aid for PWDs during the presidential and national assembly elections in the country. The presidential and the national assembly elections were conducted on Saturday. Amina Zakari, a board member of the foundation, said only 26 braille ballot guides and 60 magnifying glasses were provided for PWDs in about 273 polling units. Zakari said the visually impaired and persons with albinism were supposed to be provided with about 21,165 magnifying glasses at 16,071 polling areas. She said persons with hearing problems had 6,167 posters available at 5,085 polling units, while only 234 out of 273 voting areas could be reached. Zakari said INEC only prioritised 211 out of 273 polling areas with PWDs across the country. “In the FCT, for instance, Kubwa village/Kofar Saraki (37-02-09-001) and DeiDei primary school (37-02-09-059) both in Kubwa ward, Bwari LGA are expected to have at least 6 to 13 registered visually impaired persons,” she said. “As such, at least one braille ballot guide should be provided at these polling units, on the contrary, large font posters were the only assistive devices made available. “While magnifying glasses are expected at these PUs, they were only provided at Lugbe FHA Gate (37-06-03-024). “As such, at least one braille ballot guide should be provided at these polling units; on the contrary, large font posters were the only assistive devices made available.” The foundation further raised concern over the unavailability of adequate voting materials such as assistive devices, ballot papers, the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), result sheets, ballot boxes, and the voter register at the polling unit. She added that many PWDs could not exercise their franchise over long hours of waiting and the unavailability of aid devices.
