The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says 87,209,007 permanent voter cards (PVCs) have been collected across the country. Mahmood Yakubu, the INEC chairperson, announced the development on Thursday during a media briefing at the national collation centre in Abuja. The commission had initially fixed December 12 to January 22 for the PVC collection exercise in all LGAs. The commission then extended the deadline till January 29 and again till February 5. Speaking at the briefing, Yakubu said while the commission is pleased that the rate of collection is higher than in previous years, there are still many PVCs uncollected. According to data distributed to journalists, out of 93,469,008 registered voters in Nigeria, 93.3 percent have collected their PVCs. However, 6,259,229 cards — representing 6.7 percent of PVCs — remain uncollected. The data also shows that Lagos leads in the number of collected PVCs with 6,214,970, followed by Kano with 5,594,193, and Kaduna with 4,164, 473. Meanwhile, the states with the highest number of uncollected PVCs include Lagos – 845,225, Oyo – 515,254, and Ogun – 410,281.
