Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, says the national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) does not care about the people of the state. The governor spoke on Tuesday during the PDP campaign flag-off rally at Ahaoda West LGA of the state. He said the party’s leaders abandoned the state during the 2022 flooding events, but went ahead to visit other states. He said the electorate in the state will use the power of their permanent voter cards (PVCs) to “pepper” them in the upcoming elections. “You had a problem, a major problem. Ahoada West, Ahoada East, Abua-Odual, had a major flooding problem,” Kelvin Ebiri, Wike’s special assistant on media, quoted him as saying. “After they’ll say we are in the same party. Is there anybody from the national of our party that came to visit Ahoada West, Ahoada East, and Abua? “But they went to other states, which means that they don’t like us. If somebody says he doesn’t like you, will you force yourself on them?” Wike, however, called for massive mobilisation to ensure that residents cast their votes for the PDP governorship candidate, as well as senate and state assembly candidates. “What I want to advise you this time is, don’t allow those ballot box snatchers in APC to try it again. Luckily this election is not election of snatching ballot boxes or paper,” he said. “It is election that will be done electronically and transmitted electronically. All we need from you is to mobilise your people unit to unit.”
