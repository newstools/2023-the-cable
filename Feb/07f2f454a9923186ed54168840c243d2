The Department of State Services (DSS) has asked political parties to apply restraint in their utterances prior to and after the general election. The secret police issued the caution in a statement by Peter Afunanya, its spokesperson, on Tuesday. The warning comes hours after Femi Fani-Kayode, a former minister and director of new media in the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council, was questioned over a tweet he made. In the tweet, Fani-Kayode alleged Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), met with some army generals. In the statement on Tuesday, Afunanya said political parties and their media managers must avoid comments that could lead to violence. “Political parties and their media managers are advised to apply restraint in their utterances and public communication engagements prior to and after the general elections,” he said. “This is to avoid heating up the polity and evoking tendencies that could lead to violent reactions as well as undermine peace and order.” The spokesperson also said Fani-Kayode has been asked to return for further questioning on his claim. “The DSS hereby informs the public that it invited Chief Femi Fani-Kayode to its National Headquarters, Abuja on 13th February, 2023. The invitation was in respect of an investigation of some of his allegations and insinuations relating to issues relevant to national security,” he said. “Chief Fani-Kayode faced a panel which interviewed him on the subject matter. “Afterwards, the service granted him administrative bail and directed that he make routine returns to the Office with effect from Wednesday, 15th February, 2023 till otherwise. “The investigation, however, continues.”
