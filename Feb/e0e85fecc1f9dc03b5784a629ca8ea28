It is less than 24 hours before the presidential election and as required by the law, the campaigns have come to a halt. While it lasted, the top four presidential candidates crisscrossed Nigeria to canvass support and these moments were captured in colourful images showcasing supporters, culture, and creativity. Here are some outstanding shots from the top four candidates — Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Peter Obi of Labour Party (LP), and Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). ‘You’ — Atiku addressing his supporters in Nasarawa Atiku and Okowa all smiles as they wave at their supporters in Abia Atiku and his wife, Titi, in a lovey-dovey moment  PDP campaign team in Bauchi   Power to the people Asiwaju reading a document Tinubu exchanges salute with security officials Kaduna raises brooms for Tinubu Tinubu and Ganduje doing the ‘Buga’ dance Buhari stands on Asiwaju’s mandate APC stalwarts ride on Tinubu’s bus of ‘renewed hope’ ‘I’m here for you’ — Tinubu in Kogi City boy ‘peaces out’ in home boy’s (Shettima) Borno 4 + 4?
