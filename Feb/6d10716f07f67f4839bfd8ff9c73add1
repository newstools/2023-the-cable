The Kano government has commenced the distribution of palliatives to residents to cushion the effects of the naira notes scarcity. Speaking on Monday during the distribution of the palliative at the government house, Abdullahi Ganduje, the governor, said Kano, being the most populous state in the country, is the most affected by the “unfortunate development”. He said the beneficiaries of the palliatives are from all 44 LGAs of the state. Kano is joined as a plaintiff in a suit challenging the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) over the naira redesign policy. “We didn’t invite this situation, neither did we pray for it. We don’t welcome it at all. We gave similar palliatives during the COVID-19 days,” Ganduje said. “Today our citizens are being faced with COVID-23 caused by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). “We earlier thought it was a simple disease, but unfortunately it turned out to be a very serious virus. “This virus which came from the CBN has affected all our commercial banks, our POS, our ATM machines, and all other things associated with this. “We will not stop blaming the CBN for this economic blunder. We love our people. Therefore, anything that will disturb their well-being must be rejected.” The governor said that Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has promised to stop the hardship if elected. “Our candidate Sen. Bola Tinubu has promised Nigerians that when he is elected in the forthcoming election, he will make sure that he puts a stop to the current hardship,” Ganduje said.
