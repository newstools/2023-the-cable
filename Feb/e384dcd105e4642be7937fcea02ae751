The federal capital territory administration (FCTA) has revoked the approval granted for the construction of a three-storey building in Gwarimpa area of Abuja. On February 2, the three-storey building which was still under construction collapsed, leaving several people trapped, while 21 persons were rescued from the rubble. Following the collapse of the building, the FCT minister had directed security agencies to arrest the developer of the building. In a statement on Tuesday, Muhammad Bello, the FCT minister, said the FCTA and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) “have set up a technical team to look into the report prepared by the FHA on the circumstances surrounding the collapse”. “This was one of the decisions reached at a meeting between top officials of the FCTA and the FHA where the report was presented to the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello by the Chairman of the FHA, Senator Lawal Shuaibu on Monday, 6th February, 2023,” the statement reads. “The FCT Minister and the FHA Chairman both regretted the loss of lives and commiserated with the families of the deceased while directing that a compensation plan be prepared for them. “The meeting resolved that the investigation by the technical team is also aimed at strengthening the internal working mechanism of both agencies and that all those found culpable in the building collapse will face appropriate punishment commiserate with the crime committed. “The FCT Minister announced that in line with FCTA policy, the allocation of the collapsed building be revoked. “The meeting also commended the various agencies involved in the rescue efforts that saved 21 lives and stressed the need for cases of contraventions to go beyond mere issuance of ‘stop work’ notices. “Both organisations resolved to work very closely together to prevent any future occurrence.”
