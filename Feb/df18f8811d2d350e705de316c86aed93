Victor Osimhen, the Nigerian striker, continued his fine goalscoring form with the breakthrough goal as Napoli defeated ten-man Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 in their UEFA Champions League (UCL) first leg round-of-16 tie in Germany. The 24-year-old striker gave Napoli the lead on 40 minutes in a true striker’s fashion. Osimhen converted Herving Lozano’s low cross at the back post to hand Napoli the lead at halftime. The Naples side secured victory on 65 minutes when Khvicha Kvaratskhelia backheeled a pass to Giovanni Di Lorenzo who slotted into the far corner to give Napoli a convincing lead going into the second leg in a fortnight. In the blockbuster clash of the night, Real Madrid survived a two-goal deficit to thrash Liverpool 5-2 at Anfield. In a repeat of last season’s final, the 14-time UCL winners and reigning champions went behind to Darwin Nunez flicked into the net from Mohamed Salah’s pass. The Egyptian also doubled Liverpool’s advantage ten minutes later when he robbed Thibaut Courtois of the ball in 14 minutes. Vinicius started the comeback with two goals to restore parity at halftime. Eder Militao seized the initiative for Real Madrid two minutes into the second half with a header before Karim Benzema all but sealed the tie with two goals. RESULTS
