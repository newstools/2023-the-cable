The Labour Party (LP) has rejected the result of the presidential election held in Badagry LGA in Lagos, as announced at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) collation centre in the state. Announcement of the presidential election results for LGAs in Lagos is ongoing, with Segun Agbaje, resident electoral commissioner (REC) of INEC, in attendance. Speaking after the declaration of the result for Badagry LGA, a representative of the LP said the figure announced for her party do not reflect the outcome of the voting on Saturday. According to the result read by the collation officer, LP had 10,956 votes, while the All Progressives Congress (APC) secured 31,903 votes. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) polled 6,024 votes, while the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) got 153 votes. Of the 227,518 voters registered in the LGA, 53,939 were accredited, of which 50,618 were valid votes. The INEC collation officer also said there was no cancellation. Reacting to the result, the LP representative said the figure for her party does not tally with what she has even though the agent signed the result sheet. “The agent told me she signed at gunpoint,” the LP representative said.
