The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has dedicated its 622 toll free number as the hotline to report incidents that may affect voters during the general election. In a statement on Tuesday, Umar Danbatta, NCC vice-chairperson/chief executive officer, said the measure was part of efforts to ensure hitch-free elections. Garba said the toll free line would help the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) address emergent issues that may arise at the voting centres. “In view of the importance attached to the upcoming presidential election, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has dedicated its Consumer toll free Number 622, to serve as 2023 presidential election Incident Hotline to enable voters and members of the public across Nigeria to report any issues that may affect them, or others, during the elections on Saturday, February 25, 2023,” he said. “The toll free Number 622 is the second-level complaints centre through which consumers of telecommunications services are allowed to make calls directly to the commission, to resolve issues concerning their telecommunications services which the service providers are unable to do. “This is with a view to resolving such issues by contacting and conveying such issues to relevant agencies, authorities, or organisations for timely resolution. “The 622 Election Incident Monitoring Centre will be manned by top Management officials of the Nigerian Communications Commission. The hotline will be open to the public from 8.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. during the Presidential and National Assembly elections. “Members of the public are, therefore, invited to take advantage of the election incident monitoring centre Hotline, 622.”
