Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), says the electoral body has no candidate in the upcoming elections. Yakubu spoke on Saturday while addressing election supervisory presiding officers (SPOs) during a training in Abuja. He advised them to be committed to their oath of neutrality and allegiance to Nigeria, adding the electoral choice of candidates is left for Nigerians to decide. “The commission is determined that the 2023 general election will be the best ever and you are the people that will help the commission to make it happen and help to ensure that Nigeria has a pleasant experience on election day,” he said. “INEC is not a political party. INEC has no candidate in the election. Our only interest is in the processes. The choice of who becomes what in Nigeria is left to the Nigerian people to decide. “You are the people who supervise those who will work at the most important level, the Polling Units (PUs) level. That is the only place where voting takes place. “The collation officers at the polling units level are collating results from the PUs. When collation officers at the PU go to the local government level, they are collating results from the PUs. “When it goes to the state level they are collating results from the PUs and when they come to Abuja, where we collate the presidential result it would have passed through all these processes. “So, by the time the results come to Abuja, Nigerians would have known the outcome of the election “Our responsibility is simply to collate. So you are playing a very critical role. What will help you help the commission, help Nigerians and the electoral process is your Integrity as individuals.” The INEC chairman said the training of the election officers was going on in all states and the federal capital territory (FCT) to ensure the elections are conducted effectively.
