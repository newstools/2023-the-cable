The Lagos police command says it has uncovered a plan by some groups to unleash violence in the state. In a statement on Monday, Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, said the groups plan to take advantage of the scarcity of the new naira notes. Nigerians across the country have been battling with the scarcity of new naira notes over the past days. The development has led to queues at automated teller machine (ATM) points and protests in parts of the country. While warning the groups to abandon their plans or face the law, the police spokesperson also urged residents not to panic as security personnel have been deployed to ensure safety. “The Lagos State Police Command has uncovered plans by some groups of persons to take advantage of the new Naira notes scarcity to unleash violence in some parts of the State,” the statement reads. “The Command hereby warns these groups to shelve their planned violence or have the full weight of the law to contend with. “Lagos State residents and visitors are enjoined not to panic as the Police, in conjunction with other security agencies, embark on confidence-building patrols across the Lagos metropolis. “In the meantime, all law-abiding Lagosians are encouraged to go about their lawful duties without any fear of harassment or intimidation as the Command has ensured optimal deployment of human and operational resources towards guaranteeing their safety and security.”
