Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says governors elected on the platform of the party saved the country from “avoidable and dangerous political crises”. Tinubu was reacting to the supreme court ruling on the deadline for the naira swap. A seven-member panel of the apex court led by John Okoro, a justice, on Wednesday temporarily restrained the federal government from banning the use of the old naira notes beyond February 10. The ex parte application was filed by governors of Kaduna, Kogi, and Zamfara states. In a statement on Wednesday, Bayo Onanuga, media director of the APC presidential campaign council, quoted Tinubu as saying that the country was heading to anarchy but the ruling has brought it from the precipice. “I want to salute the courage of our governors and most especially the progressives governors in APC who acted to save our country from avoidable and dangerous political crises and social unrest which the central bank policy on new naira notes has brought on our country,” he said. “Our country was dangerously careering toward anarchy and political and economic shutdown. But with the supreme court interim ruling, our country has been pulled back from the precipice. “We thank our supreme court justices for ruling wisely on the side of the people who have been subjected to undue agony and pains since this policy was announced. “The federal government and relevant stakeholders can now sit down and work out a better framework on how to proceed with the new policy without causing any social and economic disruption and inconvenience to our people. We have examples of other countries that have successfully and seamlessly changed their currencies to learn from. “Those countries give a long time, at least 12 months to effect the currency change. They do not engage in CBN-like Fire Brigade approach.” The candidate said his aim for running for president is to make life better for Nigerians.
