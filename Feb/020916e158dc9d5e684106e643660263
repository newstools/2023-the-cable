Femi Fani-Kayode, a former minister of aviation, says it was a challenging experience facing an investigation panel at the Department of State Services (DSS) headquarters. Fani-Kayode, director of new media in the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council, reported at the office of the secret police on Monday after he was summoned. The former minister was invited by the DSS for tweeting that Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), met with some unnamed army generals. Speaking with reporters at the national secretariat of the APC in Abuja after meeting with agents of the secret police, he said at the right time, the PDP presidential candidate would be invited for questioning. “We have no choice but to have confidence in the system, we have no other system and where to go. By and large, the system works. Sometimes, it may not get it right but most of the time, they get it right,” Fani-Kayode said. “I appreciate the fact that when it comes to national security we have to be careful for all our sakes, especially at a time like this. “I won’t criticise anybody at this time for doing their job. It was extremely challenging for me at 62 to be confronted by a panel like that of very strong young men. It was not an easy thing but we went through it. “I issued a statement about three or four days ago expressing my concern about some reports in the media that suggested that Atiku Abubakar had some meetings with some generals in the Nigerian military. “Based on that, I now asked questions about what he was doing and I suggest that it was possible, if true, that the most important thing is that there is a wider script, a hidden agenda.” The former minister is expected to report back at the DSS HQ on Wednesday.
