Seyi Makinde, governor of Oyo, has announced the suspension of his campaign activities over the lingering petrol and cash scarcity. TheCable had earlier reported that residents of Ibadan, the capital of Oyo state, took to the streets to protest the scarcity of petrol and naira notes. In a statement on Friday by Wasiu Olatunbosun, Oyo commissioner for information, the governor suspended the campaign “in solidarity with the people”. “As a mark of honour to citizens and residents of Oyo state, the executive governor of Oyo state, Seyi Makinde has directed that all campaign activities of the party at all levels be suspended until further notice”, the statement reads. “Governor Seyi Makinde’s love for his people necessitated this unprecedented move at this time. “We urge all residents and citizens of the state to remain calm as we navigate through this difficult period together.” Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari, at a meeting with governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assured him that there was “capacity, manpower, and equipment” to print enough new naira notes. He also expressed concern over “inefficient, selfish and greedy” banks, who are not committed to the naira redesign policy, and asked Nigerians to give him seven days to take a “major decision” on the naira note situation.
