 Residents of Benin, the capital of Edo state, have taken to the streets to protest the lingering scarcity of naira notes in the country. A witness told TheCable that residents set bonfires on major roads and also attacked banks in the state capital. A branch of Access Bank Plc was set on fire by aggrieved protesters. Some of them were said to have attempted to break into the state branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) located along Akpakpava Road, a commercial nerve centre in Benin. This development comes hours after the supreme court adjourned the case on the CBN’s naira redesign policy till February 22 for hearing of the consolidated suits by 10 states. The court joined Katsina, Lagos, Cross Rivers, Ogun, Ondo, Ekiti, and Sokoto states as co-plaintiffs in the suit challenging the naira redesign policy of the Federal government. Similarly, the apex court joined Edo and Bayelsa states in support of the federal government on implementation of the naira redesign policy. Below are pictures:  In a video seen on social media, other banks were also subjected to attacks.
