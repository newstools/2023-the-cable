Mary Leonard, United States ambassador to Nigeria, says women’s participation in Nigeria’s politics has gone backwards in space of four years. According to a recent report by Premium Times, currently, only 7.3 percent (8 of 109) of Nigeria’s senators are women, while only 3.6 percent (13 of 360) of the members of the house of representatives are women. Speaking at the International Women’s Day award gala in Lagos, Leonard said she hopes more women participate in the nation’s politics. “In my own country, we are always a little disappointed that there aren’t more women participating.  I think Nigeria, from the last election, has gone backwards in terms of participation,” she said. “So, I hope when young women and all women in  Nigeria are looking at this process, they might think a little bit about wanting to participate in it. There is also more about demand. As a young woman, when you have a representative in office, remind them of the pledges they made and hold them to account.” Leonard also said the United States is not supporting any candidate in the forthcoming presidential election, adding that the US is interested in the peaceful, credible and transparent process of the election. “It is very important to remember that the only poll that is going to count is that of INEC. The United States is not supporting any candidate, but we support the process. We want a process that is peaceful, credible and transparent. Every Nigerian has a role in making that a reality,” she said.
