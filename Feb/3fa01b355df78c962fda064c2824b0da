Manchester United defeated Nottingham Forest 2-0 in the second semi-final clash of the Carabao Cup at Old Trafford on Wednesday night to advance into the final of the competition. Second-half goals from Anthony Martial and Fred ensured the Mancunians closed out a 5-0 aggregate victory that put them on the cusp of winning their first trophy since 2017. Taiwo Awoniyi, Super Eagles striker, was absent from the squad as he continues his spell on the sidelines due to injury. Man Unitedâ€™s goals came in the space of three second-half minutes with Martial finding the bottom corner in 73 minutes to mark his return from injury with a goal. Fred then finished off a fine team moves to seal the win three minutes later. Man United will face Newcastle United who saw off Southampton with a 3-1 aggregate victory. Newcastle also have a chance to win their first major silverware since 1969. The Carabao Cup final will take place on Sunday, February 26. Photo credit: Reuters
