Kingsley Coman scored the only goal as Bayern Munich produced a dominant display in their 1-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in their UEFA Champions League (UCL) round of 16 first leg clash at Par des Princes stadium in Paris on Tuesday. The German champions, who ended the match with ten players following a Benjamin Parvard dismissal in added time, exposed a star-studded but lacklustre PSG side that have now lost their last three matches in all competition. In a repeat of the 2020 UCL final, Coman, whose goal won the title for Bayern repeated the trick when he struck the decisive blow on 53 minutes as the French winger volleyed home Alphonse Daviesâ€™ ball. Kylian Mbappe, on return from injury as a second half substitute, found the back of the net late on but the goal was ruled out for offside in the build-up. The German champions take their slim advantage into the second leg in Germany on March 8. In the other game of the night, Brahim Diaz scored a seventh-minute winner as AC Milan also secured a slim 1-0 advantage for their second leg encounter in England. RESULTS
