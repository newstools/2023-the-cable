Charles Oke, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ward chairperson in Ogbaku community, Mbaitoli LGA of Imo state, has been shot. Oke was reportedly attacked by the gunmen who ambushed him on Saturday evening. The assailants were said to have gained access to his compound by scaling the fence. A community source told TheCable that the ward chairperson was shot on the leg and is receiving medical treatment. “The PDP chairman was shot in his house by gunmen who were waiting for him in his compound,” the source said. “He was returning home from a function when the criminals attacked him, shooting his left leg. “Before he could raise an alarm and perhaps seek coverage in his house, they already ambushed and shot him. The attackers scaled the fence and ran away immediately. “The victim has been rushed to a hospital where he is being treated. “Nobody knows why a ward chairman of an opposition party could be attacked in such a manner.” Speaking on the development, Collins Opuruzor, PDP’s publicity secretary in Imo, said the party is on top of the matter, adding that they will soon make their position known to the public.
