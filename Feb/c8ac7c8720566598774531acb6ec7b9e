Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says he and Datti Baba-Ahmed, his running mate, represent a new Nigeria. In a statement on Thursday, Obi reiterated his pledge to lead a new Nigeria where unity, peace, love, and prosperity would reign. The former governor of Anambra state said Nigerians should remember that power belongs to them and the government is there to serve them. “As we campaigned across states, cities, towns and villages of our dear Nation, my heart was filled with great concern but also with joy and hope,” he said. “We saw real and multidimensional poverty, undeserving unemployment and living conditions; decaying and unavailable basic infrastructure; avoidable crisis, accidents, deaths, and unchecked insecurity and criminality. “As we end the campaigns, Datti Baba-Ahmed and I fully reiterate our pledge and deep commitment to lead a New Nigeria where unity, peace, love and prosperity will reign. “We sincerely thank all Nigerians particularly the ‘Obidients’ and all our supporters across the country for their abiding faith in us. We commit and pledge to pursue and exceed your expectations for a New Nigeria.” Obi said uniting the country would be a top priority. “We will lead and task security agencies to locate and rescue all Nigerians still being held captive by bandits and criminals including Leah Sharibu, remaining Chibok girls and others,” he added. “Our farmers must return to their farms to feed Nigeria. We will execute a national security strategy starting with three level (federal, state, local) policing anchored on accelerated human and physical development; drive our national security strategy on data, intelligence, insights, and technology in addition to enhanced physical presence of our men and women in uniform.”
