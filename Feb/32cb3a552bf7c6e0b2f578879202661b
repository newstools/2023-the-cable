The much anticipated presidential election is finally here. Nigerians will today troop out to decide who will lead them for the next four years. Candidates from 18 political parties are gunning for the top position but of that number, there are four frontline candidates. The battle for the presidential seat is between these major contenders unlike what was obtainable in the 2019 elections where the contest was between the candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It is a fight to finish between Bola Tinubu, standard-bearer of the APC; Atiku Abubakar of the PDP;  Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP), and Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Will Tinubu be able to work his way out of the expected protest votes against the APC and retain the seat for the party? Can Atiku’s unifier message work in his favour and sway the electorate to his side? Or is the craving for a new order — away from recycled politicians — enough to pave the way for Obi as the new president? Can Kwankwaso prove his mettle and deliver victory for the NNPP? This Saturday’s election promises to be intriguing and unpredictable. All eyes will be on the performance of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies as they ensure that the electoral processes are not subverted.
