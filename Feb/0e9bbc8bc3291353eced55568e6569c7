Accidental strikes by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) have killed over 300 civilians in the country, says a new report by SBM Intelligence. In the report titled “Air Force Mishaps” released on Monday, SBM said the incidents happened in pursuit of terrorists. SBM Intelligence, a research organisation, compiles and analyses data about happenings in the country. The report said the mistakes had risen in the last two years with little acknowledgment from the air force. SBM listed Yobe, Borno, Nasarawa, Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara, and Niger as the worst-hit states. In January, TheCable reported that an airstrike in Doma, a community that connects Nasarawa and Benue states, killed 37 people. SBM said the incident was the latest in the “pattern of impunity that has come to colour military operations in Nigeria”.
