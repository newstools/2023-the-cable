Former President Olusegun Obasanjo says persons who have retired as police officers should not be appointed to chair the Police Service Commission (PSC). In January 2023, the senate confirmed Solomon Arase, retired inspector-general of police (IGP), as substantive chair of the PSC after President Muhammadu Buhari asked the upper legislative chamber to confirm him in line with sections 153 (1) and 154 (1) of the constitution as amended. Prior to Arase’s appointment, Musiliu Smith, a former IGP, served as chair of the PSC. Speaking on Wednesday at the public presentation of a book titled ‘Policing the Nigeria Police’, authored by Simon Okeke, a former chairperson of the PSC, Obasanjo said retired police officers should not be appointed to head the PSC. He said police officers should instead be appointed as members of the commission, while civilians should be appointed as chair. He said this would ensure effective and efficient service delivery. Speaking on the book, the former president also spoke on the concerns raised about the establishment of state police. “I won’t say yes or no, but can they not be abused by the federal government?” he asked. “For a federation, it is contrary to the ideal of the country because unitary policing system is not close enough to the community where the police are supposed to be. “The author argued whether the name should truly be the Nigeria Police Force or a police service. I believe the police should be a police service, not a police force.”
