Alexander Hamilton, American Politician and Founding Father of the U.S., has said this election processaffords a moral certainty that the office of President will seldom fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. This is often premised on the assumption that the electoral process reflects the people’s choice, being free, fair, and credible. Electronic voting systems have become increasingly popular in recent years as countries across the world strive to make their elections quicker, more secure, and accessible to a larger audience. But how do these systems work, and what are the opportunities, risks, and challenges that come with them? This article will explore the various aspects of electronic voting systems. We will look at how they can benefit the election process, as well as the risks associated with them. Then we will discuss some of the challenges that must be addressed for these systems to be implemented successfully. Finally, we will explore some potential solutions to these challenges. The electronic voting system is a great way to ensure everyone’s vote is counted. However, this type of voting has some flaws. Here are some things to consider:
– One of the biggest concerns with electronic voting is security. Hackers always have the potential to interfere with the electronic voting system. Because electronic voting systems are typically connected to the internet, there is a risk that they could be hacked or tampered with. This could lead to election fraud or even manipulate the outcome of an election. There have been some high-profile hacking casesrecently, so ensuring that any electronic voting system is properly secured is important.
– If there is a power outage or dead battery, the electronic voting system may not be able to function properly. This could lead to delays in the voting process or even inaccurate results.
– Some people may not be comfortable using an electronic voting system. They may prefer the traditional paper ballot method because e-voting could disenfranchise them. For example, if there is a problem with the software or hardware used for electronic voting, it could prevent some people from being able to vote. This could potentially result in voter suppression if certain groups are disproportionately affected by these problems. Electronic voting can potentiallytransform the way we vote. By eliminating the need for paper ballots and making the voting process more efficient, electronic voting can make voting more accessible and convenient for everyone. However, some risks associated with electronic voting should be considered before implementing this type of system. Overall, there are both opportunities and risks associated with electronic voting. It is important to consider these factors carefully before implementation.Electronic voting systems (EVS) aregrowing in popularity, but their reliability and security have been questioned.Additionally, EVS can be expensive to implement and maintain. Despite these challenges, EVS offersmany potential benefits, including:-
• Increased accuracy and transparency – With electronic voting, there is a reduced risk of human error in the voting process. Using a hybrid of traditional and e-voting, picture and keyed-in numbers uploaded through encrypted channels can make election results far more credible. In addition, electronic voting can provide a verytransparent election process, as voters can see their choices immediately after casting their ballot.
• More efficiency – Electronic voting can save time and money by reducing the need for paper ballots and manually counting votes. In addition, electronic voting can make managing turnout logistics at polling places easier.
• Increased accessibility – Electronic voting can make it easier for voters with disabilities to cast their ballotsindependently – with speech options. In addition, electronic voting can allow voters who cannot physically attend their polling place (e.g. overseas or military voters) to participate in elections. Of course, electronic voting systems come with challenging areas that must be managed to ensure a fair and secure election. However, with proper planning and design, these risks can be minimized. Moreover, it is good to look into the Bimodal voter accreditation systems (BVAS), used during the ongoing Nigerian Presidential election to verify voters’ identities and ensure that only eligible voters can cast a ballot. BVAS can be used with electronic voting systems (EVS) or as a standalone system, as was the case. The Nigerian 2023 elections allowed for many flaws, which questions the credibility of the declared results, from non-compliance with agreed guidelines to unavailability of upload tokens, even worse, the delayed upload of polling unit results made the entire process questionable. In the United States, however, about 23% of registered voters live in jurisdictions that primarily use ballot marking devices, machines that allow voters to make their selections electronically and produce a paper record that another device can scan.Additionally, about 70% of registered voters live in areas that primarily use hand-marked paper ballots, according to data from Verified Voting, an organization that tracks voting technology (Matt Zdun, 2022). The challenge with the Nigerian elections lies in the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC’s none adherence to its own stipulated and agreed guidelines, making the published results subject to manipulations. Nonetheless, there are several advantages of using BVAS in EVS if electoral officers adhere to the agreed processes:
• BVAS can provide a higher degree of accuracy in voter identification than EVS alone.
• BVAS can help to prevent voter fraud and electoral malpractice.
• BVAS can improve the transparency and accountability of the electoral process. However, some loopholes are associated with using BVAS in EVS:
• BVAS may introduce additional complexity to the electoral process, necessitating more user education.
• There is a risk that BVAS could be used to disenfranchise legitimate voters if it is not properly designed and implemented for inclusiveness – like designing with features to assist voters with disabilities to cast ballots unaided. While electronic voting systems offer a more convenient and efficient way to cast ballots, there are still some concerns about the security of these systems. It is important to address these security concerns to make electronic voting more attractive to voters. One way to do this is by ensuring that electronic voting systems are properly tested and audited before they are used in elections. That way, end-to-end encryption is put in place for better results upload. Another way to increase confidence in electronic voting is by allowing voters to verify their votesafter they have cast them. This can be done by providing a paper trail of each uniquely identified vote or by allowing voters to view an online receipt that shows their vote was successfully recorded – with unique identifiers that could be later referenced. Making electronic voting secure and attractive to voters is essential for this type of voting system to be adopted on a wider scale. By addressing the security concerns around electronic voting, we can make progress towardmaking this voting more accessible and convenient for everyone. Besides, you can do a few things to ensure your vote is counted when it comes to electronic voting. First, make sure you understand how the system works. If you have any questions, ask a poll worker or election official. Second, be sure to confirm your choices before you submit your ballot. Once you hit the “submit” button, your vote is final. Third, if you use a touchscreen voting machine, check that your choice is correctly recorded before moving on to the next page or screen. fourth, remember that some electronic voting systems allow for a paper backup of your ballot. If this option is available, be sure to take advantage of it. And finally, don’t forget to double-check your confirmation screen or receipt before leaving the polling place to ensure your vote was properly cast. Electronic voting systems offer many advantages to the current paper-based system, from reducing costs and increasing efficiency to providing a transparent audit trail. However, it is important for governments to fully understand and evaluate all potential risks before implementing any such system to ensure its safety and accuracy. Additionally, proper training should be provided to election officials on how best to use the technology tomaximize its effectiveness and minimize any errors or discrepancies that may occur during polling day. That said, Harry Emerson Fosdick, American Pastor, touted that Democracy is based upon the conviction, there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people (emphasis mine). With these considerations in mind, electronic voting can be a powerful tool for modernizing our democracy and improving access tocitizens’ right to suffrage. Thank you for the investment in time.
