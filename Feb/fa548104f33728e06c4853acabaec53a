A federal high court in Kano has granted permission to one Mahmoud Lamido, to seek an order to compel the police to arrest Abdullahi Abbas, the state’s chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC). In the ex parte application marked FHC/KN/CS/01/2023, Lamido accused Abbas of threat to life, disruption of peace, and hate speeches. Through his counsel, Bashir  Muhammad,  the plaintiff told the court that the APC chairman, in a phone call, insinuated that he would kill him. He asked the court for an order granting him leave to apply for an order of mandamus to compel the state police commissioner to take action against Abbas. Simon Amobeda, presiding judge, granted the application on Tuesday. “Leave of this honourable court is hereby granted to the applicant to apply for an order of mandamus to be issued against the commissioner of police Kano, for investigation and arraignment of Alhaji Abdullahi Abbas (Kano State APC Chairman) for threat to life, distraction of peace, and hate speeches capable of causing public disturbance,” the judge ruled. The matter has been adjourned to February 16, for report on compliance.
