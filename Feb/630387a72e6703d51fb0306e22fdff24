An aircraft belonging to the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), on Monday, made an emergency landing at the Murtala Muhammad international airport in Lagos. In a statement on Monday by Wapkerem Maigida, spokesperson to NAF, the aircraft was said to have lost its tyres and did a “controlled belly land” at the Lagos airport. A belly landing refers to an emergency situation in which an aircraft lands without its gear in a lowered position, and is “usually caused by equipment malfunction”. The air force, however, said no casualty was recorded from the incident. “A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) maritime patrol aircraft, a Cessna Citation CJ3 on a routine flight today, 6 February 2023 lost its tyres on touch and go flight in Ilorin and had to carry out a controlled belly land at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos,” the NAF statement reads. “Fortunately, there were no fatalities or injuries to any crew member and persons on the ground.‬ “The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, has directed the immediate constitution of a Board of Inquiry to determine the cause(s) of the accident. “The NAF continues to solicit the understanding and support of the general public as it daily strives to ensure the security of Nigeria and Nigerians.‬” The incident comes years after a lost tyre incident that affected an Air Peace aircraft, which eventually crashlanded at the same airport in Lagos.
