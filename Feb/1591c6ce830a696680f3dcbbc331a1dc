Dauda Lawal, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara, says seven persons sustained gunshot injuries following an attack on his convoy. In a statement on Friday, Lawal accused the state’s anti-thuggery committee of being behind the attack, which he said occurred around the A.A. Rano filling station, off Sani Abacha way, on Thursday. The PDP candidate said his wife and her entourage were the occupants of the vehicles in the convoy at the time. Describing the incident as “horrific”, Lawal said two police officers and five civilians were shot and are currently receiving medical treatment in Gusau, the Zamfara capital. “During the attack, two of my police security escort, an inspector, and a sergeant alongside five other civilians were shot and are currently receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre, Gusau,” he said. “You can recall that about a month ago, the same anti-thuggery committee stormed the Gusau central motor park in Gestapo style and killed two innocent civilians, including a little kid, for political reasons.” He also asked security agencies to ensure that the perpetrators of the attack face justice. “I also call on the inspector-general of the police and all other law enforcement agencies to conduct a proper and holistic investigation of this matter and prosecute whoever is found responsible for this attack on innocent persons, regardless of his status or position in government,” he said. “This cowardly act is an apparent attempt at political assassination targeted at my person for political reasons, which is unacceptable.” Efforts to reach Mohammed Shehu, Zamfara police spokesperson, for comments on the attack were not successful as he did not respond to calls or message.
