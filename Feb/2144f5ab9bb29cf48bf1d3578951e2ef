The organisers of the previously-failed European Super League have announced a new-look format for the tournament which would see 80 teams competing in a “multi-divisional competition”. Bernd Reichart, the chief executive of the A22 Sports Management Group, which is behind the plans for the creation of the Super League, told the German newspaper Die Welt on Thursday that 50 European clubs have been consulted over the proposals since last October. Reichart added that 10 principles based on the creation of the Super League have also been developed. “The foundations of European football are in danger of collapsing. It’s time for a change. It is the clubs that bear the entrepreneurial risk in football,” he said. “But when important decisions are at stake, they are too often forced to sit idly by on the sidelines as the sporting and financial foundations crumble around them. “Our talks have also made it clear that clubs often find it impossible to speak out publicly against a system that uses the threat of sanctions to thwart opposition. Our dialogue was open, honest, constructive and resulted in clear ideas about what changes are needed and how they could be implemented. There is a lot to do and we will continue our dialogue.” Florentino Perez, Real Madrid’s president, announced the creation of the European Super League in April 2021. The 12-team competition had the traditional ‘big six’ from the English Premier League (EPL) and other top European clubs from Spain Italy and Germany all signing up for the money-spinning venture. The initial proposal attracted widespread criticism and protests. FIFA and UEFA would later wield the big stick as 9 clubs involved — AC Milan, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, Atletico Madrid, and Inter Milan — publicly withdrew their interest. Real Madrid, Juventus, and Barcelona, however, remained resolute.
