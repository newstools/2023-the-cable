Charles Adias, the state collation officer for the presidential election in Rivers, has adjourned the collation over an alleged threat to his life by unarmed party supporters. The returning officer, who is also the vice-chancellor of the federal university of Otueke, confirmed this to journalists on Tuesday at the collation centre in Port Harcourt, Rivers. Aderemi Adeoye, the commissioner of police, has asked Adia to reveal the names of those behind the threat to his life, but the returning officer insisted that he won’t do such. He said he won’t continue with the collation process unless the INEC resident electoral commissioner of the state addresses issues concerning the threat against his life. Meanwhile, 21 results from 24 local governments of the state have been collated, while the two being expected are those of Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, and Ipalibo Banigo, his deputy. Wike is from Obio-Akpor, while Banigo is from Degama. This development comes amid the viral petition on change.org being circulated on social media. The petition, which has been signed by over 12,000 Nigerians, calls for the UK, USA, Canada, and European and Asian countries to cancel the visa belonging to Wike due to his involvement in the destruction of the electoral process in the state
