The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says it has no plan to issue any sit-at-home order during the general election. In a statement on Thursday, Emma Powerful, IPOB spokesperson, said the group has no interest in Nigeria’s election but is focused on the release of Nnamdi Kanu, its leader, who is in detention. “IPOB has no plan or intention to order any sit-at-home during the election period,” it said. “IPOB led by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has never forcefully obstructed the election process in Nigeria. Rather, we once called Biafrans to boycott elections, which was later called off. “We have maintained that we don’t have any interest in the Nigeria shambolic political selection process called Nigeria elections scheduled for February 2023. “Our interest and focus is the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and the date for Biafra referendum for Biafrans to determine their political future in or outside Nigeria.” IPOB also issued a warning to a group, the “Pan Nigeria President of Igbo Extraction Coalition (PANPIEC)”, to stop linking it to “criminal gang issuing and enforcing sit-at-home orders to blackmail IPOB and ESN”. “It’s on record and in the public domain that IPOB has not called for any sit-at-home during February elections. It’s also obvious that IPOB and ESN do not have any faction or splinter groups,” it added. “IPOB remains peaceful and indivisible under one command for the liberation of Biafra Nation from the damnable Republic called Nigeria.” It added that any group claiming to be IPOB and ordering sit-at-home is criminal and be regarded as a “sponsored” agent.
