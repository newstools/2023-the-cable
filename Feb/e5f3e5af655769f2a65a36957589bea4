Yakubu Dogara, a former speaker of the house of representatives, says the endorsement of Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), by President Muhammadu Buhari is a “satire”. At an APC campaign rally in Nasarawa on Saturday, Buhari said Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos, is the next president of the country. Also, in a tweet, the president said Tinubu would give his best to Nigeria. “Today in Lafia, Nasarawa State, I delivered my message: VOTE Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the next President of Nigeria, and VOTE Governor Abdullahi Sule for a 2nd term,” the president tweeted. “I have known Asiwaju for more than 20 years; he is a committed Nigerian; he will give his best to Nigeria!” Dogara, in his reaction, said he knew Buhari loves cracking jokes but he didn’t know it would escalate to the level of satire. “I know that PMB loves to crack jokes but I didn’t know he would escalate it to the level of satire. Asiwaju’ll give his best to Nigeria, really? Fake certificates, fake parentage, golden triangle escapades, racketeering,” the former speaker tweeted. “No PMB, Nigeria does not deserve his best but we get the satire.” I know that PMB loves to crack jokes but I didn’t know he will escalate it to the level of satire.Asiwaju ll give his best to Nigeria,really? Fake certificates,fake parentage,golden triangle escapades,racketeering. No PMB, Nigeria does not deserve his best but we get the satire. https://t.co/zLk3heSNdx — Rt Hon Yakubu Dogara (@YakubDogara) February 4, 2023  In December 2022, Dogara threw his weight behind Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “While the duo (NNPP and LP) may emerge as strong contenders in the political arena in the future, from all indications, PDP appears to be the best option to adopt and support,” a joint statement put out by the lawmaker and the Northern Leaders Consultative Forum read at the time.
