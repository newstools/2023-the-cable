The United States has announced an extension of the validity of tourist visas for Nigerians from two years to five years. In a statement on Monday, the US mission in Nigeria said the extension will take effect from March 1, 2023. The development comes days after the Nigerian government announced that it had entered into an agreement with the US on the extension of tourist visa validity for both countries. According to the Nigerian government, the new visa policy will cover tourist visas, as well as visas for diplomats and government officials. In its statement, the US mission said despite the validity extension, the application fee will not increase. “Effective March 1, 2023, the U.S. Mission will increase visitor visa validity from 24 months to 60 months for Nigerians who want to enter the United States temporarily for business and/or tourism,” the statement reads. “The visa validity extension allows Nigerians to use the visa for 60 months to make short trips to the United States for tourism or business purposes before having to renew their visa. “The visa application fee, currently USD160, will not increase as a result of the increased visa validity. “Increasing visa validity is one of several initiatives taken by the United States to reduce visa appointment wait times in Nigeria. “The U.S. Mission continues to offer No-Interview Visa Renewals to those who meet the eligibility criteria.  Appointments for No-Interview Visa Renewals are readily available.” You can read more on the criteria for no-interview visa renewals here.
