Adams Oshiomhole, former national chair of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has been elected to represent Edo north senatorial district at the national assembly. Oshiomhole was declared the winner by Benjamin Adesina, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) returning officer, on Sunday. The APC chieftain polled 107,110 votes to defeat Francis Alimikhena of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the incumbent, who scored 55,344 votes. “Adams Oshiomhole of APC, having scored the highest number of votes, is hereby declared as the winner of the election conducted on the 25th of February for Edo north senatorial district,” Adesina said. The former APC national chair had earlier defeated Alimikhena in the APC primary for the senatorial seat before the latter resigned from the party to join PDP. Oshiomhole joined the senatorial race in May 2022 after he had declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the APC. He made a U-turn from his presidential ambition during an event to mark his 70th birthday in Edo, and said he would seek to represent Edo north in the upper legislative chamber.
