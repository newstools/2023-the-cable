The European Union Election Observation Mission (EU-EOM) says election observers will not violate their oath to remain neutral in Nigeria. On February 25, Nigerians will head to the polls to elect a new president and members of the national assembly — senate and house of representatives. Also, on March 11, governorship and state assembly elections will be conducted. On Sunday, the EU-EOM led by Robert Hall and Diana Ferrari visited Olumba-Olumba Obu, the founder of the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star, (BCS), in Calabar, Cross River capital. Speaking during the visit, Hall said the team would observe the polls in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states. He said the mission would maintain neutrality while observing the elections. “We are election observers on assignment to Cross River and Akwa Ibom and we received good reports on the spiritual leader and his large followers he has influenced positively in Nigeria,” Hall was quoted as saying by NAN. “Since we are to educate the electorate on the need to participate in the general election by casting their votes, there is a need for us to visit the Leader of BCS. “Speaking about neutrality during the election, nothing can make us violate our mandate or the oath taken to be neutral in the election.” On his part, Obu assured the EU delegates of safety throughout their stay in Nigeria, while urging them to freely carry out their duties. “I urge Nigerians to conduct themselves peacefully during and after the general election. This election must be devoid of vote buying, rigging, violence, and killings,” he said. “On EU’s request to know more about BCS, my mission and teachings border on love, forgiveness, peace, and unity of all races.”
