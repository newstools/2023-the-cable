Geidam Bulama, a principal medical officer, who was abducted by the Islamic State of the West African Province (ISWAP), in Borno state, has been released. A source said Bulama was released in Gubio, before he was moved to Maiduguri where he was reunited with his family. It was not clear if a ransom was paid before his release. Bulama was abducted in March 2022, when the insurgents invaded Gubio LGA, about 70 kilometres from Maiduguri, Borno state. The insurgents were said to have attacked the town and looted food items and fuel from a humanitarian truck. Residents fled for safety during the attack, returning to their homes after the insurgents had withdrawn from the town. Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency expert and security analyst in the Lake Chad region, reported that during the abduction of Bulama, the insurgents had promised his wife that they would not kill him. Zagazola quoted sources as saying that the insurgents took Bulama and other abducted victims to the border of Lake Chad. He was said to have been forced to treat wounded fighters and their families for several months. Zagazola said efforts of the state government and the security agencies led to the release of Bulama.
