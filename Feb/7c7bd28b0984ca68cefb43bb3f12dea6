Point of sale (POS) operators in Nigeria have increased transaction charges as the scramble for cash persists in banks across the country due to the scarcity of the new naira notes. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has continued to advise Nigerians to use POS terminals — a critical aspect of its cashless policy — as alternative means for transactions. The apex bank announced the naira redesign policy in October 2022. Following the unveiling and commencement of the circulation of the redesigned naira notes on December 15, 2022, the CBN ordered deposit money banks (DMBs) to stop issuing the new notes over the counter. Although the policy is adjudged to be economically beneficial in the long run, it has immediately caused a massive cash shortage nationwide. Despite the CBN ordering over-the-counter withdrawals of the new naira notes to ease up queues at automated teller machines (ATMs), and also extending the deadline for the use of old ones, the scarcity persists. Consequently, Nigerians, in their search for cash, now face an unpalatable dilemma: to endure a huge throng in banking halls/ATMs or pay high transaction fees to POS operators. A customer in Alagbole, Ogun state paid N300 to get N2,000. POS OPERATORS HIKE FEES On Friday, TheCable reporters observed that some POS operators in the Ikorodu area of Lagos shut down services due to a lack of cash. One of the merchants said the scarcity is forcing them to increase charges as it has become difficult to obtain cash from banks. TheCable understands that these hikes in POS fees are prevalent across the country. “I live in Oyo but I had to go to Ibadan on Monday. I was charged N2,000 for every N10,000 before I later found someone in the market who did N400 for N20,000 on old notes and N800 on new notes,” Victoria Peace said, narrating her ordeal. “On Wednesday, I paid N500 for N5,000. And the maximum amount you can withdraw from their POS is N5,000. “As at yesterday, it is now N1,000 for N5,000. “People are fighting each other at the ATM stands so, I can’t even go there. Banks are also becoming fraudulent and the network isn’t allowing us to pay for stuff with our cards.” Another affected person (name withheld) said most POS terminals in Kano have shut down, adding that not all of them have the new notes. “It is very difficult to find one with money and even if you find one, they may not be able to give you all the money you want to withdraw,” the Kano resident said. TheCable also understands that some operators, especially in Lagos and Kaduna, are rationing the cash in their possession, and rejecting withdrawals above N5,000.
