Manchester City scored two second-half goals to overcome Arsenal 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday to depose the Gunners from the top of the English Premier League (EPL) table. Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland scored the goals that sealed the victory for Pep Guardiola’s side after Kevin de Bruyne and Bukayo Saka had exchanged goals in the first half. De Bruyne pounced on a poor back pass to finish over Aaron Ramsdale and hand City the lead on 24 minutes but Mikel Arteta’s side was handed a lifeline three minutes before the interval with a penalty kick dispatched by Bukayo Saka. Grealish made it 2-1 to City in the 72 minutes after City pounced on another poor pass in defence, before Haaland dispatched De Bruyne’s pass to seal the vital win eight minutes from time. Man City are now on 51 points from 23 matches, the same as Arsenal whom they lead based on better goals difference. They returned to the top of the league for the first time since November at the expense of the hitherto-impressive Arsenal. Elsewhere in Europe, luckless Chelsea lost 1-0 to Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League (UCL) encounter in Germany, thanks to a stunning goal by Karim Adeyemi. The 21-year-old German striker of Nigerian heritage showed lightning pace to take a flick-on and run through to goal for 70 yards before rounding the goalkeeper and slotting into an empty net. The German Bundesliga side held on to take a slim advantage going into the second leg in England.
