Adewole Adebayo, the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), says Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should concede to Bola Tinubu. His statement comes amid calls by the LP and PDP for Mahmood Yakubu, the chairperson of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to cancel the presidential election. Also, Olusegun Obasanjo, former president of Nigeria, had said the INEC chairperson should declare “void and inadmissible” election results where “BVAS and servers have been manipulated or rendered inactive.” Adebayo, in a Twitter post on Tuesday, said Abubakar and Obi should show they love Nigeria by conceding to Tinubu. “Chinua Achebe was right that leadership is the problem of Nigeria. Where are the true leaders? Same drama every election year is not progress,” Adebayo wrote. “@GEJonathan saved us in 2015. It is now time for @atiku and @PeterObi to show that they love Nigeria. Time to call @officialABAT is now. “I have more grievances than all the presidential candidates combined. I’m least satisfied with the results. I am dissatisfied with the choice of the electorate. “It is the prerogatives of the people to make unwise choices but the choice is clear. We can be more honest all around.” Chinua Achebe was right that leadership is the problem of Nigeria. Where are the true leaders? Same drama every election year is not progress. @GEJonathan saved us in 2015. It is now time for @atiku and @PeterObi to show that they love Nigeria. Time to call @officialABAT is now — Adewole Adebayo ESQ (@Pres_Adebayo) February 28, 2023
