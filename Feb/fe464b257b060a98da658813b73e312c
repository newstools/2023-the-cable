The Lagos chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has announced the suspension of its campaign activities over the current petrol shortage and naira note scarcity. In a statement on Tuesday by Seye Oladejo, Lagos APC spokesperson, the party said the decision was taken due to the impact of the scarcity of petrol and naira notes on the masses. He said it will be insensitive to continue with the campaign rallies with the current situation of things. “The Lagos State Chapter of All Progressives Congress has suspended its campaign towards the forthcoming elections,” the statement reads. “According to a release by the party, the state chairman, Hon. Cornelius Ojelabi, said the decision was reached as a result of the state of the nation due to the scarcity of fuel and pain occasioned by the Naira redesign. “He empathises with the general public, especially the downtrodden who are at the receiving end. “He expressed the view that it will be insensitive to forge ahead with the various rallies with the situation of things. “He emphasised that members of APC are not immune to the development as he has been inundated with several complaints. “He joined his voice with those of other well-meaning Nigerians to call for the review of the Naira redesign policy to give it a human face and ameliorate the suffering of ordinary Nigerians. “He equally appealed that petroleum products should be made available in order not to jeopardise the preparation for the elections and reduce the negative economic impact. “He enjoined all Lagosians to remain law abiding as all issues are resolved in due course.” This development comes after Seyi Makinde, the governor of Oyo, announced the suspension of his campaign activities over the lingering petrol and cash scarcity.
