Hussaini Kabir, a resident of Gyallesu in Zaria, Kaduna state, has lamented the inability of the bimodal voter accreditation system (BVAS) to differentiate between him and Hassan, his twin brother. Hussaini, a supporter of Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said he went to the polling unit with Hassan on Saturday. The identical twins are known for sharing photos about their lives on social media. In a Twitter post, Hussaini said he was unable to vote because his twin brother voted before him. He also said the BVAS indicated that his face was the same as that of his twin brother who had voted earlier. The BVAS is an electronic device used to read permanent voter cards (PVCs) and authenticate voters using fingerprints and facial recognition. In the post, the social media influencer said efforts to use his fingerprint also proved abortive. ‚ÄúSo, I couldn‚Äôt vote because my twin voted  before me. Unfortunately for me, the machine indicated that same face was scanned. Fingerprint didn‚Äôt work also. Saddened (to be honest) tbh. I remain Atikulated,‚Äù he wrote.
