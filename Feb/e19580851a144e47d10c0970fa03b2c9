Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Kashim Shettima, his running mate, were in Rivers state for the partyâ€™s campaign rally on Wednesday. Rotimi Amaechi, ex-governor of Rivers and former minister of transportation, was not in attendance at the rally. Amaechi had also contested the presidential ticket of the APC. Although the former minister has not attended most presidential campaign rallies of the APC since the flag-off in November 2022, in January 2023, he attended the rally in Adamawa. Tonye Cole, governorship candidate of the APC in the state, and other party stakeholders were also at the rally. Below are pictures from the event.
