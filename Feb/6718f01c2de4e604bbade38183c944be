Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, an Igbo socio-cultural association, has reaffirmed its support for Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP). Alex Ogbonnia, national publicity secretary of the organisation, in a statement on Wednesday, said the group has received the information of its women’s wing endorsing Atiku Abubakar, standard bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ogbonnia said Ohanaeze’s support for Obi is irrevocable, noting that it is in resonance with right-thinking patriotic Nigerians that the LP candidate stands out as the “most suitable, competent visionary, inspiring and energetic presidential candidate for the forthcoming general election”. He said the organisation was shocked that while Afenifere, pan-Niger-Delta forum (PANDEF), middle belt, and the Muslim clerics were in support of the Obi/Datti movement, the women’s wing embarked on a mission completely at variance with the interest and position of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. “The National Executive Committee (NEC) of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, presided over by our Secretary-General, Amb. Okey Emuchay sat at the National Secretariat, No 7 Park Avenue, GRA, Enugu on Friday, February 17, 2023, and reaffirmed its irrevocable support for Mr. Peter Obi, the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party,” Ogbonnia said. “Obi is not only an exceptional convergence of history, equity, and public consciousness, he is also a moral edifice, purveyor of excellence, a quintessential public administrator, and the embodiment of the new Nigeria that all Nigerians crave for. “Ohanaeze Ndigbo vehemently dissociates itself from such an unwarranted, unconscionable, and subversive endorsement of Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) by its women wing.” Ogbannia called on Nigerians to ignore all forms of distractions and come out on Saturday to discharge their civic duties by voting for Peter Obi and Datti Baba-Ahmed.
