The Kaduna state government has directed its ministries, departments and agencies to ensure revenue collection agents accept payments made in old and new notes. The order was contained in a statement on Sunday, signed by Muyiwa Adekeye, special adviser to the governor on media and communication. The state government said the directive was in line with the subsisting order of the supreme court. “In line with the subsisting order of the supreme court, the Kaduna state government has directed its ministries, departments and agencies to ensure that their collection agents continue to accept payments made in all denominations of the naira, old and new,” the statement reads. “The laws of Kaduna state do not allow personnel of government agencies to be involved in cash collection of revenues. “The collection agents authorised by the state government agencies do offer citizens a route for cash payment, and are expected to comply with the subsisting court order.” President Muhammadu Buhari had announced the extension of the validity of the old N200 notes till April 10. Buhari, in a televised nationwide address on Thursday, said all existing old N1000 and N500 have ceased to be legal tender, but noted that the denomination remain redeemable at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and designated points. This came less than 24 hours after the supreme court insisted that the old notes were still valid, and adjourned the case filed by several states — including Kaduna — challenging the deadline on the old notes till February 22. In a counter directive following the president’s national broadcast, Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, said all the old and new notes remain legal tender in the state pending the supreme court’s decision. Meanwhile, the CBN has commenced the collection of the old naira notes as ordered by Buhari.
