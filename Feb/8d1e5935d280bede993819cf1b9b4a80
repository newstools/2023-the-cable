The federal government says the President Muhammadu Buhari legacy portal, an electronic repository of his achievements, will be inaugurated soon. Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, spoke on Tuesday in Abuja, at the 26th edition of the President Muhammadu Buhari (PMB) administration scorecard series. “As the administration winds down, we decided to consolidate all the publicity programmes that we have held all through the administration’s tenure,” NAN quoted Mohammed as saying. “This gave birth to the PMB administration scorecard series (2015-2023), which we launched on October 18, 2022. “The scorecard series, designed to massively showcase the achievements of the Buhari administration and document such for posterity, has five components.” He said the achievements would be chronicled in book form. The minister said a testimony series that provides a platform for Nigerians to say how they have been impacted by the various policies and programmes of the administration, would also be inaugurated. He added that there would be a documentary that provides video evidence of the administration’s major achievements. The minister thanked Buhari for his “unflinching support and the confidence”reposed in him. He also thanked his colleagues, and other ministers, for honouring the invitation to present their scorecards, despite their tight schedule. Mohammed also expressed gratitude to the media for their support, and for constantly putting the government on its toes.
