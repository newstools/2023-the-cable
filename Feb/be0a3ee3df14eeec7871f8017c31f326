Chimaroke Nnamani, senator representing Enugu west senatorial district, has insisted that his suspension by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) did not follow due process. In a statement issued on Monday, Nnamani, who is also a former governor of Enugu, described the suspension as “incurably messy”. In January, the national working committee (NWC) of the PDP suspended him over alleged anti-party activities. Debo Ologunagba, the PDP spokesperson, who announced the suspension, said the decision was taken after an “extensive review” of the party’s activities in the country. In 2022, Nnamani publicly expressed his support for Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The lawmaker said he is supporting Tinubu because of the PDP’s refusal to zone its presidential ticket to the south. He said the suspension was ill-conceived and unwarranted. Nnamani said his right to a fair hearing was violated because he was neither informed of any complaints against him nor was he invited to answer any query. “The PDP ‘Penkelemesi’ suspension without hearing is incurably messy and will collapse,” the statement reads. “My decision to pitch tent with Asawaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was necessitated by the PDP refusal to comply with its own constitution to wit; that key political office should at all times be rotated between the South and North to guarantee harmony, peace, fairness, equity, and justice. “As it is now, there is no fairness, justice, and equity in the PDP because both the Presidential Candidate and the National Chairman are from the same region. “I am only exercising my right to freedom of choice and association. On this score, I  stand with Tinubu.” Nnamani asked the PDP leadership to put its house in order, adding that his suspension by the NWC lacked both moral and constitutional backing.
