Real Madrid were crowned the Club World Cup champions following a 5-3 victory over Odion Ighalo’s Al Hilal on Saturday. The final of the competition was played at the Prince Moulay Abdallah Stadium in Rabat, Morocco. Two goals apiece from Vinicius Jr. and Frederick Valverde, and another from Karim Benzema led Madrid to a record-extending fifth Club World Cup trophy. The Galacticos got the show on the road courtesy of a quick-fire double, with Vinicius finding the back of the net after which Valverde repeated the trick to make it 2-0. Moussa Marega halved the deficit with a cool finish for Al Hilal before the interval. After the break, the goals continued to flow, with Benzema oozing class on his strike and Valverde further punishing the Saudi Arabian side. Luciano Vietto scored twice to reduce the deficit on either side of another Vinicius strike in the highly entertaining encounter. The Club World Cup is Madrid’s second trophy of the season, adding to the European Super Cup won at the start of the season.
