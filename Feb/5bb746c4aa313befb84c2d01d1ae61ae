The Nigerian Army has inaugurated a general and special martial court to investigate 68 officers over alleged misconduct during military operations in their various divisions. The inauguration of the special court took place on Friday at the TY Buratai auditorium in Giginya barracks, Sokoto state. Speaking during the inauguration, Godwin Mutkut, general officer commanding, 8 division, Nigerian Army, and the commander of the joint task force (north-west) of operation Hadarin Daji, said the courts were set up to ensure justice for the victims. Mutkut asked the court officials to properly examine all evidence according to the principles of fairness. He also said the court will be free from any external influences, while those accused will have adequate time to defend themselves. Mutkut, however, called on the prosecuting and defence counsel to shun undue adjournment of cases to avoid delayed justice. Clement Iyere, a brigadier-general, was appointed as president of the special court, while Bashir Yusuf, a colonel, will be in charge of the general court.
