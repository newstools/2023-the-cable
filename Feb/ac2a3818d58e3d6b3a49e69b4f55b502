Babatunde Fashola, minister of works, has made a comment which appeared to be directed at Abdul-Azeez Adediran, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos. Speaking on Thursday at the unveiling of “10,000 foot soldiers” for the Tinubu/Shettima presidential campaign, the former Lagos governor said Adediran, better known as Jandor, lacks the experience to perform well as governor of the state. Fashola also said Jandor being a “cameraman” to him for eight years doesn’t mean he is qualified to contest the position of governor. “You need experience. I did that job for eight years. And part of what helped me was that I was chief of staff to a governor. I saw it up close but even with then, that wasn’t enough,” he said, “So, following a governor, being a cameraman, and watching me for eight years, and you think you will now be a governor, you are not ready. “Come to our leadership school. You’re not yet ready. And that is why you will see their adverts. They are focusing on the N51 billion that Lagos is generating, but they don’t see the immigrant population that is coming in every day. The bigger the prosperity, the bigger the problem.” Meanwhile, Jandor was a member of Fashola’s media team when he governed Lagos for eight years.
