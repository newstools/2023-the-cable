Victor Osimhen, Super Eagles forward, has won the Serie A goal of the month award for January. The winner was announced on the league’s Twitter page on Thursday. The Nigerian scored a volley in Sunday’s league clash against AS Roma. His club Napoli won the match 2-1. The goal came in the 17th minute and was the opening finish of the game. Osimhen was at the end of a tidy cross-in from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. The Nigerian cushioned the ball on his chest and redirected it with the thigh before smashing a shot into the roof of the net beyond Rui Patricio. It was the 24-year-old’s 14th league goal of the season, adding to his comfort at the summit of Serie A’s goal scorers.
