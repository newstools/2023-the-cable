Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says he will ensure that the Ajaokuta steel plant is “resuscitated” if he is elected. The former Lagos governor said this on Wednesday during the party’s presidential campaign rally in Lokoja, the capital of Kogi. “Hope is here. Ajaokuta resuscitation will be done. Dredging of the Niger River will be done. Agriculture will be the source of our prosperity. North-central has the potential for great mineral industrialisation; we will work on that,” he said. “They even rejoiced when you cannot sell your products. You will never see hardship in your lives. You will see prosperity, you will see progress. “This is your determination; I want you to multiply it. On the 25th of February, there will be a vote for the president, senators, and house of representatives members. It is in your hands now. “But we have come to remind you, whether by Keke Napep or by bicycle or even with your legs, you should go there in the morning. Cast your vote and be vigilant. Do your part; play your own role. “I guarantee you I know how to do it. I am smarter than their candidate. I am the frontrunner, the best candidate. I know the road. I am a man who knows how to develop wealth, a man who keeps promises.”
