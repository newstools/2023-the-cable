Sadiya Umar Farouq, minister of humanitarian affairs, disaster management and social development, says 15 million individuals and households have benefitted from the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP). Farouq said this on Tuesday at the 23rd edition of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration’s scorecard series held in Abuja. The National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) was established by the federal government as part of efforts to tackle poverty. Projects of the NSIP include the N-power programme, conditional cash transfer (CCT), school feeding, and Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP). She said the NSIP has positively changed the lives of Nigerians since it was launched. “Today, the ministry has directly touched the lives of over 15 million individuals and their families. Through the commitment of his excellency, President Buhari, these life-changing programmes are being institutionalised and continue to receive the necessary funding,” she said. She said more than 9.9 million children across the 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT) have benefitted from the national home-grown school feeding programme. While highlighting other achievements to include the empowerment of 1.5 million youths through the N-power programme, the minister said the national senior citizens centre has developed a 10-year plan for the implementation of the national policy on ageing.
