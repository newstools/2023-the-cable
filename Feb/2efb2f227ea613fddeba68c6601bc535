The All Progressives Congress (APC) has postponed its presidential campaign rally slated for Tuesday in Oyo state. In a statement on Monday, Olawale Sadare, the party’s spokesperson in Oyo, said the decision was taken over the “crises” tied to the naira scarcity and petrol shortage. There have been protests in parts of the country — including Oyo state — over the scarcity of new naira notes and petrol shortage. However, amid the development, President Muhammadu Buhari has asked for some days to take a “major decision” on the naira note scarcity. Speaking on tbe postponement of the rally, Sadare added that the party will give the president time to address the concerns raised over the issues. “We need to allow President Muhammadu Buhari to work around the situation and ensure that normalcy returns, particularly as it concerns fuel and currency notes crises,” NAN quoted him as saying. “At Oyo APC, we were convinced that it was necessary to go ahead with the event in order not to play into the hands of some antidemocratic forces who do not want the general elections to hold. “We regret to announce the indefinite postponement of our presidential rally earlier slated for Tuesday. ‘The decision was taken in consideration of the prevailing challenges facing the nation.” He also said the party will let the public know the new date as soon as the decision is taken. The party also urged its loyalists to remain calm, and expressed optimism of victory in the general election.
