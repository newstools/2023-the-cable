Godwin Obaseki, the Edo governor, has announced a ban on cash transactions in all government offices across the state. The governor said the ban would take effect from March 1. He spoke on Thursday in Benin, the Edo capital, during a workshop for senior civil and public servants on the state government’s code of ethics. The development comes amid the naira redesign policy which has resulted in a cash crunch as citizens struggle to get naira notes from banking halls and automated teller machines (ATMs). Speaking at the event, Obaseki said the state government would jettison cash transactions for a more transparent cashless mode of transactions. “I have issued a circular that effective March 1st, government offices will be prohibited from using cash,” the governor said. “The government is pushing toward a cashless economy. So, why must the service dodge transparency? “We should be able to explain every amount we spend and how we earned it.” The governor also expressed his dissatisfaction over unethical activities and behaviour in the civil service despite his administration’s investment in the welfare of state workers. “We have a crisis on our hands. The level of waste and corruption in our public service must be reduced,” he added. “We must agree to be fair to the government and the people who are your employers.”
