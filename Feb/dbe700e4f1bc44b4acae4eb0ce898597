Mohamed Salah opened the scoring as Liverpool overcame Everton 2-0 in their English Premier League (EPL) Merseyside Derby at Anfield on Monday night. The Egyptian striker has had an average season so far in the EPL but regained some form to haunt Liverpool’s cross-town neighbours, with Cody Gapko sealing the win. Salah set Liverpool on the path to victory by finishing off a counterattack with aplomb as he converted Darwin Nunez’s cross for the first goal. Gakpo then sealed the win early in the second half when he converted at the back post after the Everton defence failed to clear a cross, earning his first goal for the club in the process. The win is Liverpool’s first in five league matches. They last won an EPL match on December 28 against Leicester. Jurgen Klopp’s side moved up to the ninth position on the log with 32 points from 21 matches, one point ahead of tenth-placed Chelsea.
