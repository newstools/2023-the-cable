Osita Ngwu, an engineer, has been elected as the senator to represent Enugu west senatorial district in the national assembly. Ngwu polled 52,473 votes to be declared as winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). His closest contender, Dennis Amadi, candidate of the Labour Party (LP), polled 48,053. Ezeh Chika and Udeagulu Cletus, candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) got 3,825 and 1,052 votes to come third and fourth respectively. Ngwu will be replacing Ike Ekweremadu, the incumbent, who was first elected in 2003. Ekweremadu held the office of deputy senate president three consecutive times in the sixth, seventh, and eighth assemblies. The first two times were under David Mark, a former senator representing Benue south and former senate president, and the last time under Bukola Saraki, a senator representing Kwara central and also a former senate president. The senator, who nursed a gubernatorial bid but later dumped it, is currently facing an alleged organ harvesting charge in the UK.
