Buba Galadima, a chieftain of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), has accused a section of the media of “suppressing” the chances of Rabiu Kwankwaso, the party’s presidential candidate. Speaking on an Arise TV programme on Wednesday, Galadima said Kwankwanso would “shock everyone” and be elected the president of the country. He claimed there is a “grand conspiracy” to downplay the wave that the NNPP presidential candidate is making. Galadima said the party will “crush” the schemes at the poll on Saturday. “A section of the press has been compromised to make sure they suppress us. The truth of the matter is that this grand conspiracy would be crushed in the next three days’ time,” he said. “Kwankwaso is the only candidate that is popular, competent, strong and has worked hard. In the last five days, we have crossed about 10,000km on the road, we held rallies and the response has been unprecedented. No candidate can master the support of the people like NNPP is doing. “People are acting like they are not seeing our strides because it is Kwankwaso, the man that should be suppressed by the press. Kwankwaso will shock Nigerians in the next three days.” The NNPP chieftain claimed that a governor has accumulated “N22 billion” ahead of the election, saying that is the reason some state governments are suing the federal government over the naira redesign policy. “We are not politicians that only campaign in the TV or ditch out money. Thank God Buhari has dealt with them, and money is not going to be an instrument in this election. Even though we are aware that certain candidates collected money directly from the CBN that is why they are supporting the policy,” he said. “Some people have accumulated money — up to N22 billion — in the house of one governor. They are all shouting because they have been shortchanged by Buhari.”
