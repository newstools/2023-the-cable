Kola Abiola, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), says the All Progressives Congress-led administration has imposed “untold hardship” on Nigerians due to the currency redesign policy. In a statement released by his campaign council on Sunday, Abiola said the naira redesign and cash swap has been executed in an insensitive manner by the government. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had given a deadline of January 31 for the use of old notes — but it was recently extended to February 10. Despite the extension, Nigerians have continued to battle with lengthy queues at banking halls and automated teller machines (ATMs) amid the scarcity of new naira notes. Abiola promised that if elected as president, such uncoordinated and insensitive actions would become a thing of history. “We will never again experience this kind of avoidable misfortune that has befallen the citizens of this great country,” he said. “As an administration, we will demand sound policies and coordinated implementation across board from CBN such that things will be done the correct way.” Abiola, therefore, urged the electorates to let their votes speak loudly by electing him, assuring Nigerians that the party would implement people-centred policies. He said that the PRP held the golden key to unlock and redeem the people from the shackles of oppression and regressive government policies. “A PRP-led government will introduce and implement a Cost of Living Adjustment policy (COLA),” Abiola said. “Through a well-structured means test to determine eligibility of each family unit, we will alleviate the hardships experienced by unemployed or underemployed citizens.”
