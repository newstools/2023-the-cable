Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives, has won reelection for a sixth term in office. Gbajabiamila, who has spent 20 years in the lower chamber of the national assembly, defeated Bosun Jeje of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Surulere 1 federal constituency election. Gbajabiamila polled 19,717 votes to defeat the PDP candidate who scored 5,121 votes. Speaking after his election victory on Saturday, Gbajabiamila said he will not disappoint the people of the constituency for voting for him yet again. “I am immensely grateful to the people of Surulere for their overwhelming support. I do not take your support for granted,” the speaker said. “As your representative for the past 20 years, I have always protected your interest. I am proud of you as my constituents. I thank our teeming supporters, our Surulere APC leaders, party members, CDAs and residents for their massive support. “This victory is not mine alone. It is a victory for democracy. Surulere has made history by this sixth mandate given to me, which would definitely spur me to do more for you.” Gbajabiamila was first elected to the house of representatives in 2003 and had won five straight elections before now. The speaker has previously served as minority whip, minority leader, opposition leader, and majority leader before getting elected as speaker in 2019.
