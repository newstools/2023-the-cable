Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, says the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should not disregard the concerns raised by Nigerians about alleged infractions during the general election. Speaking on Tuesday in a statement by Terver Akase, his special adviser on media, Ortom said some violations of the electoral act were recorded during the polls. He asked INEC to take necessary action to avoid putting the country into chaos. “Though several violations of the electoral act were witnessed in the conduct of the presidential and national assembly elections, my team is assessing the situation and will make my position known soon,” he said. “I urge the people of the state to remain calm, law-abiding, and as peaceful as they have been. “Despite the pre-election apprehensions, voters in the 23 local government areas of the state went out to exercise their civic responsibility and no major breach of peace has been recorded in any part of the state. “I commend the resilience of those who were able to vote during the elections despite the current economic situation in the country.” The governor commended PDP for supporting his senatorial bid and thanked residents who cast their votes for him during the Benue north-west senatorial election. Ortom lost his senatorial bid to Titus Zam, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the state. The Benue governor polled 106,882 votes while Zam won with 143,151 votes.
