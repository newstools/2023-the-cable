Femi Pedro, former deputy governor of Lagos, says the cognitive ability of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is perfect. Tinubu has been under scrutiny over his health status since he became the presidential candidate of the APC. He has suffered a number of gaffes at campaign rallies and the mistakes have raised concerns over his fitness for office. Speaking in an interview on Channels Television on Monday, Pedro said the former governor of Lagos is “fitter than him” and though he looks “frail, he is energetic”. Pedro was the deputy to Tinubu when he was the governor of Lagos between 2003 and 2007. “Asiwaju is very fit. He is fitter than me. When you look at him, he might look like somebody who is frail but he is energetic. He is well and not sick, and you can see that he is being everywhere,” he said. “Let me assure you, Asiwaju’s cognitive skill is perfect. He has no problems at all. Most of what you heard or read is doctored. That is the narrative being presented by the opposition to tell Nigerians that the man is not fit. “We that are close to him, his supporters know that his cognitive ability is good. You have nothing to worry about. He might have made slips here and there, everybody does that. “When you are on a campaign trail, the noise, the gravitas, and the general rally atmosphere can easily make you have a slip of tongue, which is not unusual and unheard of.”
