The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Tuesday, took its presidential campaign rally to Enugu state. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, governor of Enugu and a member of the G5 governors  — a group of five PDP governors who have been absent from Abubakar’s campaign rallies — was not present at the venue of the rally. The governors — Ugwuanyi, Nyesom Wike of Rivers, Seyi Makinde of Oyo, Samuel Ortom of Benue, and Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia — are demanding the resignation of Ayu as the party’s national chairperson. Although Ugwuanyi was present when Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate, visited the government house, the governor was not at the venue of the campaign rally. The PDP presidential campaign team also held a meeting with traditional rulers in the state. Below are pictures.
