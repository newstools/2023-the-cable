The Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI) has directed bank staff to stay away from work in any state where their branches are attacked. The association had earlier said it will direct its members to suspend work if the current attacks on banks persist. Olusoji Oluwole, national president of the association, in a statement on Friday, said the attacks have continued without any form of security for the safety of its members. He said the association cannot leave the lives and properties of its members exposed to danger. “The national secretariat has been inundated with reports of threats and attacks on lives and properties of members and bank branches, and subsequently has been on the field to monitor and confirm the reports,” the statement reads. “We issued warnings and appeals to government to provide security measure for the safety of lives and properties of our members within and around the bank premises, but regrettably the attacks have continued without any form of security for the safety of our members, and the recent being the attack today, Friday 17th February 2023 on one bank branch at Epe, Lagos state. “We cannot leave the lives and properties of our members exposed to obvious danger. “Consequently, all members should today immediately stay away from work in any state where bank branches are attacked. “This is to continue every day until normalcy is restored. Please note, you will be availed further directives as events develop.” The association had said the financial implication of the nationwide rancour may cost the insurance companies over N2 billion.
