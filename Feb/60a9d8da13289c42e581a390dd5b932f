The federal high court has requested that its judges take a little vacation for them to take part in the upcoming general election. A circular signed by John Tsoho, chief judge, said the break would last from February 22 to February 28. Tsoho instructed divisional heads in Abuja, Lagos, and Port Harcourt to make sure that a judge is appointed to handle the legal requirements of the north, south-west, south south/south east geo-political zones. “In view of the forthcoming 2023 general elections, your lordships are by this Circular letter permitted to observe a short break in order to perform your civic duties,” the circular reads. “Your Lordships are to sit on Wednesday before proceeding on the break and shall resume work on  February 28. “The administrative Judges in the Abuja, Lagos and Port Harcourt Judicial Divisions, shall ensure that a judge is designated to cater for the north, south-west, south south/south east geo-political areas, respectively, regarding urgent matters during the period.”
