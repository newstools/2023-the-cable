An Ikeja sexual offences and domestic violence court, on Tuesday, sentenced a 51-year-old cleric, identified as Nduka Anyanwu, to life imprisonment for sexually assaulting two sisters in Lagos. According to NAN, the two sisters, aged 13 and 17 years old, became pregnant and have given birth. The convict was said to have defiled the two sisters on the pretext of holding prayer sessions at a church complex on Arowojobe street in Oshodi in August  2020. Abiola Soladoye, the presiding judge, held that the evidence presented against the convict was convincing and consistent. Soladayo described the convict as morally-bankrupt, adding that his name should be published in the state’s sex offenders’ register. The judge also criticised the parents of the girls, adding that they should have been charged as they were also guilty of contributing to the circumstances that led to the assault. “On several occasions, one of the survivors went back to the parents to complain about the conduct of the defendant. She was beaten and sent back to the defendant’s home,” the judge said. “The prosecution has proved the ingredients of the offences against the morally-bankrupt defendant.” The prosecution team presented five witnesses, including the survivors, their parents, and a social worker.
