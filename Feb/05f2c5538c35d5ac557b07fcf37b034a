A yet-to-be-identified man has died while inside a bank in Agbor, Ika south LGA of Delta state. The bank customer was said to have slumped and died on Thursday. There were claims earlier on Friday that the man was on a queue to withdraw the new naira notes from the bank. But in a statement issued on Friday, Bright Edafe, police spokesperson in Delta, said the man slumped and died while waiting to get an automated teller machine (ATM) card. “The report [making the rounds] that a man slumped and died while trying to withdraw new currency at a bank in Agbor is not entirely true. He slumped and died while waiting for his new ATM card pls,” Edafe wrote in a tweet.

In an effort to address long queues at ATM points and banks, the CBN had directed banks to commence payment of redesigned notes over the counter, with a daily limit of N20,000. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, assured Nigerians that everything is being done to ensure there is sufficient cash in circulation. “I am aware of the cash shortages and hardship being faced by people and businesses, on account of the maira redesign. I want to assure that we are doing everything to resolve these issues. Nigerians should expect significant improvements between now and the February 10 deadline,” he said. “I met with a delegation of Governors today, on the matter. All the complaints about the execution of the currency change are being seriously looked into. “I will ensure that everything is resolved in a lasting manner, and we will all enjoy the long-term benefits of the decision.”
