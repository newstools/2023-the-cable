The Kaduna government has warned residents against taking to the streets to protest election results. In a statement on Sunday by Samuel Aruwan, commissioner for internal security, the government directed any group or individuals who disprove election results to take advantage of  “legal instruments provided by the Electoral Act”. The state also cautioned that the announcement of results is solely the duty of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). “As the collation of election results progresses, the Kaduna State Government hereby reminds citizens that protests of any sort remain strictly prohibited across the State,” the statement reads. “The State Government has noted with satisfaction the largely peaceful conduct of elections across the state, and commends residents for exercising their franchise in an orderly manner. “Citizens must therefore avoid street protests over election results – or of any other kind – in order to preserve the atmosphere of calm so far experienced. Actions which may disrupt public peace will be handled decisively by security agencies. “It must be stressed that the announcement of election results is the exclusive duty of the Independent National Electoral Commission. Individuals and groups involved in unofficial publication of results should be aware that they constitute serious threats to public peace and order. “Individuals or groups who may have queries over officially announced results are strongly urged to utilise the legal instruments provided by the Electoral Act. “Governor Nasir El-Rufai continues to monitor closely the security situation in relation to the conduct of the elections, alongside security agencies in the State.” Nigeria held its presidential and national assembly elections on Saturday. Results of the polls are still been collated and winners are still to be announced.
