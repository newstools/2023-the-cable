Toyin Adeniji, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos state, has been killed by gunmen. The 47-year-old was reportedly shot dead in front of his house in the Agege area of the state. He was said to have been shot at close range after the gunmen invaded the area. Confirming the development, Gbenga Ogunleye, media aide to Olajide Adediran, governorship candidate of the PDP in Lagos, described the incident as “unfortunate”. “It is quite unfortunate that the spate of insecurity and avoidable deaths are rising in Lagos state. It’s very sad,” he said. Efforts to reach Benjamin Hundeyin, the spokesperson of Lagos police command, for comment on the development were not successful as messages sent to him were not responded to at the time of filing this report.
