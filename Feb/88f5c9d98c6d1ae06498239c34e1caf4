Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says those who think he has issues with President Muhammadu Buhari will be disappointed. Speaking during a campaign rally in Nasarawa state, on Saturday, Tinubu said the friendship he shares with Buhari is one that is centred on nation-building. The former governor of Lagos said Buhari is democratic and principled despite being a retired general “Those who think there are cracks in our friendship and relationship will continue to be disappointed and have their short-time joy dashed. Ours is not about individuals. It is about integrity and nation-building,” Tinubu said. “For us who joined hands with you 20 years ago to reshape Nigeria, to fight corruption, to fight destitution, to fight failure and hunger, we are proud of your achievements. “President Buhari faced the challenges of Nigeria courageously and squarely. You fought hard and worked hard. Nigeria is surviving as a nation and we believe because of constitutional democracy, we would have asked you to stay on, but you said no; you are going back to Daura. “You said there is more to do and you will allow other people to continue. There are few leaders who have faced some challenges, and crises like you did and continue to build infrastructure.” Tinubu said under him, Nigeria would overcome the challenges it is facing. On his part, Senate President Ahmad Lawan said APC has delivered excellence to the people of Nasarawa. “We are here to celebrate excellence. The people should vote for Asiwaju Tinubu. President Buhari has always come to Nasarawa to commission projects,” he said.
