Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has won the polling unit of former President Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo voted at polling unit 22, Olusomi compound, ward 11, Abeokuta north LGA, Ogun state, on Saturday. According to Punch, Tinubu scored 56 votes, Atiku Abubakar of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) got seven votes, while Peter Obi of the Labour Party scored nine votes. The African Democratic Congress (ADC) polled eight seats and Accord Party had one vote. The polling unit recorded 10 void votes. In his New Year’s message in January, Obasanjo asked Nigerians to vote for Obi, saying the former Anambra governor has an edge over other contestants. “None of the contestants is a saint but when one compares their character, antecedent, their understanding, knowledge, discipline, and vitality that they can bring to bear and the great efforts required to stay focused on the job, particularly looking at where the country is today and with the experience on the job that I personally had, Peter Obi as a mentee has an edge,” he had said.
