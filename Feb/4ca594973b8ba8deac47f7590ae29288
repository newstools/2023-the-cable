Scores of Boko Haram insurgents have been killed after two Super Tucano jets, operated by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) under Operation Hadin Kai, bombed their camps in Borno state. Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency publication focused on the Lake Chad region, said the military had intelligence suggesting that the terrorists were converging for a meeting in Gaizuwa on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest. A source told the publication that pilots flying Super Tucano jets bombed the gathering of more than 100 terrorists with dozens of them on motorcycles. The source said the bombardment of the Boko Haram fighters left many of them injured. Some of the terrorists are believed to now be at large while several motorcycles and weapons belonging to them were destroyed. The publication said some of the fighters who escaped the onslaught, and their families, have laid down their arms and surrendered to the troops. TROOPS KILL 7 BOKO HARAM FIGHTERS, DESTROY CAMPS Meanwhile, troops of 21 Armoured Brigade, in Bama, in collaboration with civilian joint task force (CJTF) officers, on Friday, destroyed four Boko Haram camps in Churchur, Mbaiwa, Kashimiri, China — and many other newly established villages — in Borno. A military source told Zagazola that seven of the insurgents were killed during the operation. The troops were said to have successfully burnt down the terrorists’ enclaves and rescued some women and children in the process.
