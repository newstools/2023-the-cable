President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday met with Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), over the scarcity of naira notes in the country. Abdulrasheed Bawa, chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), was also present at the meeting which was held at the state house, Abuja. Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto and chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), and his Kebbi counterpart, Atiku Bagudu, were also in attendance. The scarcity of new naira notes has resulted in protests in Oyo, Ogun, Ondo and Delta states. Some banks have also been forced to close their premises over their inability to meet the demands of customers. Here are photos from the meeting.
