A federal high court in Abuja has adjourned ruling on a bail application filed by Ali Bello, nephew to Kogi state governor, in a N3 billion money-laundering suit. The judge, Obiora Egwuatu, adjourned the suit till Tuesday, due to a mix-up in the filing of court documents by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC, on February 8, arraigned Bello alongside Abba Adauda, Yakubu Siyaka Adabenege, and Iyada Sadat for allegedly misappropriating N3,081,804,654. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the 18-count charge “bordering on criminal misappropriation and money laundering”. They were remanded in prison pending when the bail application is moved. Rashida, Yahaya Bello’s wife, was also mentioned in the charge. Kabiru Hussain, the prosecuting counsel, said the counter-affidavit was mistakenly taken to a different court instead of Egwuatu’s. Ahmed Raji, Bello’s lawyer, acknowledged receipt of the prosecution’s objection to his client’s bail request. He also sought a speedy hearing of the bail application. Consequently, the judge adjourned the case till Tuesday to hear the bail application.
