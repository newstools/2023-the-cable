Victor Osimhen scored a brace as Napoli defeated Spezia 3-0 in their Serie A clash at the Stadio Alberto Picco on Saturday. The Partenopeans continued their impressive run at the league’s top to reaffirm a 13-point gap above the chasing pack. Napoli did not begin the routing until the second half when Khvicha Kvaratskhelia scored from the spot in the 47th minute after a Spezia defender handled the ball in his goal area. Twenty minutes later, Osimhen got his first goal of the game, demonstrating his devastating poacher instinct. He reacted quickest and jumped highest to a loose ball in the Spezia goal area with the goalkeeper out of position. Less than five minutes after, the Nigerian was wheeling away to celebrate his second goal of the match after Kvaratskhelia had set it up for an effortless tap-in. It was his 16th league goal of the campaign, four finishes ahead of Ademola Lookman, his nearest contender. Another Nigerian Ola Aina made a successful return from injury with a sumptuous assist that earned Torino a 1-0 victory over Udinese. The fullback sent a pinpoint cross to Yann Karamoh, who flicked the ball home for the all-important lone goal of the match. In England, Kelechi Iheanacho continued his goal-scoring form with a goal and two assists as Leicester defeated Aston Villa 4-2 in their English Premier League (EPL) clash on Saturday. He provided the assist for James Maddison’s equaliser in the 12th minute after Olie Watkins had put Villa ahead. Iheanacho then got on the scoresheet with a brilliant header off Harvey Barnes’ cross in the 42nd minute, drawing the Foxes level yet again following another Villa goal. The Nigerian completed his contribution on the cusp of halftime with a tidy pass to Tite to give Leceister the lead for the first time in the game.
