Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue state, has appealed to Nigerian youths not to resort to violence and destruction of public property. There have been protests and vandalisation of financial institutions across states over the scarcity of new naira notes. In a statement, Nathaniel Ikyur, Ortomâ€™s chief press secretary, said the governor spoke when he hosted the new executive members of the Tiv Youth Organisation (TYO) on Thursday in Makurdi, the state capital. While acknowledging the hardship occasioned by the scarcity of cash and fuel in the country, the governor maintained that the destruction of public facilities because of anger would serve no useful purpose. He advised young people to make their voices heard through the election of credible leaders in the forthcoming elections. Ortom berated the federal government for deliberately making Nigerians go through pain due to the naira redesign policy. He said the time given for the old naira notes to go out of circulation was too short. The governor asked President Muhammadu Buhari to heed the advice of Nigerians, including those he perceived as enemies, and review some policies of his administration that have brought pain to the people. He also commended members of the TYO, especially the outgone executive members, for standing with his administration and speaking out at all times in defense of the people. He urged the new president to work hard to surpass the achievements of his predecessor by cooperating with the state government to ensure the development of the Benue state. On his part, Andrew Anza, president-general of TYO, assured Ortom that the organisation would continue to support his government.
