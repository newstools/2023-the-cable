The Peter Obi Support Network (POSN) says the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have resorted to propaganda. Addressing journalists on Wednesday in Abuja, Tochukwu Ezeoke, POSN’s co-convener, said Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), is the candidate to beat. Ezeoke said a vote for Obi is a vote for development in the country. “Faced with certain electoral defeat, the APC and the PDP have resorted to propaganda, political bribery, and spreading fake news and unfounded information against the Labour Party to help their demoralised supporters,” he said. “It is now obvious that the Labour Party is the party to beat and so their masters have seen the truth and are tactically submitting. “These failed politicians have failed to read the signs of times, that a new generation of Nigerians hewed in the blood of innocent Nigerians over the years have risen to take back their country and they will not stop until the day a new Nigeria is born; the 2023 elections are just the beginning.” On his part, Olatunde Okelana, the group’s coordinator in Oyo, said the youths who constitute 40 percent of the registered voters are rooting for Obi.
