Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun, has visited the resident who was shot by the police during a protest in the state. On Monday, residents of Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun, took to the streets to protest the lingering scarcity of petrol and naira notes. The twin crises have incited multiple protests across the country. Kehinde Emmanuel, a resident, had told TheCable that one person was shot while several bank branches were vandalised in Abeokuta. Announcing the visit to the victim on Tuesday, the governor said the state government will take care of the hospital bills. “This morning, we paid a visit to yesterday’s protest victim, who is currently being treated at the Federal Medical Centre, FMC, Idi-Aba, Abeokuta. We sympathised with him and loved ones over the unfortunate incident and also made a pledge to foot all his medical bills,” he tweeted.
