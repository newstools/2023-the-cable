The FIFA Women’s World Cup trophy will arrive in Nigeria on March 26. According to a statement by FIFA on Thursday, the coveted trophy will be coming to Nigeria as part of its tour to all 32 countries participating in the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. The tour begins in Japan on February 25 before crisscrossing other parts of Asia, Africa, South America, North America and Europe. It will then land in all nine host cities of the competition in the final weeks before the kickoff on July 20. A top source within the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) told TheCable that the trophy will be hosted at the Transcorp Hilton hotel in Abuja. The Super Falcons are placed in Group B for the World Cup alongside Australia, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland. The 2023 edition will be the first time two countries will host the competition. The tournament will also see the Women’s World Cup expanded from 24 to 32 teams. The Super Falcons have qualified for all the editions of the World Cup and will be hoping to surpass their 1999 quarter-final feat in Oceania. The team is, however, in a patchy form having lost all their last six consecutive games.
