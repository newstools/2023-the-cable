Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says he will “work hard” for the country if elected. Speaking on Tuesday at the grand finale of the APC presidential campaign at the Teslim Balogun stadium in Surulere area of Lagos state, Tinubu commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his efforts to support his presidential bid. Buhari arrived in Lagos earlier on Tuesday for the campaign rally finale. During the rally, the former Lagos governor said he will “diligently and vigorously” pursue all the programmes stipulated in his manifesto. “I heard loud and clear the level of confidence you have in me. In a distant country, Mr President told them of my characteristics and his faith in my capacity to do a good job as a president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I thank him very much,” the APC candidate said. “He returned yesterday and said he must come to Lagos to attend this rally. He never missed his word and promise. He promised to give to you the future of this country – to lay it in the hands of the youths. I want to say thank you very much. “I assure you that as you worked hard for me, I will work hard for Nigeria. As you give Nigerians the hope to renew their faith in their country, I will sustain that hope. I will bring it to those who look helpless today. “All the agenda in our programme – renewed hope manifesto – will be pursued diligently and vigorously with all our energy.”
