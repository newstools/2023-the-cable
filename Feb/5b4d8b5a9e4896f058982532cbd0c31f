Ibrahim Abdulkarim, a chieftain of the Labour Party (LP), says Peter Obi, standard bearer of the party, will get more votes from the north than the south in the forthcoming elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has fixed the presidential and national assembly elections to hold on February 25. The governorship and state house of assembly polls will take place on March 11. Speaking on Wednesday on a Channels Television programme, “The 2023 Verdict”, Abdulkarim said Nigerians in the north would vote for the LP candidate. He said the people are tired and want a change in the government. “Let me tell you what is happening in the north. A lot of people feel that Peter Obi is not going to have votes from the north,” Abdulkarim said. “By the special grace of God, he is going to get more votes from the north, even maybe than from some southern parts of the country, because the anger is more in the north than the people in the south. “Last week, I was in Kano, at three radio stations and I opened the line for phone-in, for more than 45 minutes, all the people that called in attested to what I am saying and agree with the Labour Party manifesto, the thinking and the ideology we are bringing onboard. It is not us doing it but the God that people have prayed to. “You don’t know what is happening in Zamfara. Zamfara is sitting on gold but there is the issue of lead poisoning because of the activities of illegal miners. “We now have the Nigerian gold market in Dubai. Every day, gold is being removed from Zamfara with all the killings in Zamfara. You can see the amount of poverty, the amount of hunger, and insecurity in Zamfara alone. Nigerians are tired.”
