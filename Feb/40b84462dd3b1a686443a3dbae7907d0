The federal government has ordered the screening of the academic and National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) certificates of staff of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF). Chris Ngige, the minister of labour and employment, announced the directive on Wednesday during the inauguration of the new board of the agency in Abuja. The NSITF has been on and off the news in recent years over allegations of fraud and certificate falsification. In June 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari sacked the NSITF management over alleged N3.4 billion fraud. Earlier in February 2023, there was reports that Michael Akabogu was removed from his position as the NSITF managing director over alleged forgery of his NYSC discharge certificate. The NSITF is now chaired by Maureen Allagoa. Speaking at the inauguration, Ngige said the certificates of all staff members must be screened within eight weeks. “In order to maintain, protect, and promote a viable and thriving organisation, I have four major tasks before the new board,” he said. “Within the next eight weeks, you have to screen certificates of all staff of the Fund. I have cause to say so. “When I see letters written by staff, including people in management positions, I start wondering if they obtained General Certificate of Education (GCE). “You should screen out impostors with fake educational and NYSC certificates.” Ngige advised the new board to improve on efforts to drive operations within the public sector, and work towards universal coverage of all the workers in Nigeria. He also asked the new NSITF board to ensure transparency and accountability in its operations.
