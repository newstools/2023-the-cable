Super Falcons defeated Costa Rica 1-0 in their final fixture at the 2023 Revelations Cup in Mexico. Esther Okoronkwo’s goal on the stroke of halftime was the sole difference between the Randy Waldrum-led girls and Costa Rica at the León Stadium in the early hours of Wednesday. The victory was the team’s first of the competition after losing the first two games to Mexico and Colombia. The win also saw the team halt a seven-game defeat run. The Falcons dominated the Costa Ricans, with Rasheedat Ajibade particularly vivacious in creating chances. Daniela Solera in goal for Costa Rica was equalled to the task until the 45th minute when Jennifer Echegini blitzed to the byline before floating a cross towards the far post.

The goal was enough and earned Nigeria a third-place finish in the four-nation tournament. It was also the team’s first win since defeating Cameroon in the quarter-finals of the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco in July.
