A high court in Port Harcourt, Rivers state capital, has sentenced two former operatives of the disbanded special anti-robbery squad (SARS) over the murder of suspects. Margaret Opara, the trial judge, sentenced Shedrack Ibibo and Magus Awuri, the two former SARS officers, on Thursday. The officers were convicted over the murder of Michael Akor and Michael Igwe. BACKGROUND On June 22, 2009, five former SARS officers arrested Akor and Igwe in Oyigbo LGA of Rivers state over alleged stealing. The bodies of the suspects were said to have been found in the bush the day after the arrest. The ex-officers who arrested the suspects are Samuel Chigbu, Shedrack Ibibo, Magus Awuri, Ogoligo, and Olisa Emeka. The officers were subsequently dismissed from the police and charged with murder. In September 2017, a court sitting in Port Harcourt found the ex-officers guilty of extrajudicial killing and ordered the police force to pay N50 million as compensation to the families of the victims. THE VERDICT During the course of the trial, Samuel Chigbu and Ogoligo died in the prison facility in Port Harcourt. The trial judge convicted and sentenced Ibibo and Awuri, while Emeka was acquitted. Speaking after the judgment, Kathrine Akoro, the mother of one of the victims, expressed satisfaction with the judgment. “They killed my son, carried our property in 2011. My son said I should forgive them, let them go and bring those things they took,” she said. “I said if you are carrying all those property, bring my son, I will be okay. I thank God He has fought for me. I am happy.”
