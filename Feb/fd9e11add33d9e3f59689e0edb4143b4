President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday met with Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), over the scarcity of naira notes in the country. Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto and chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), was also in attendance at the meeting. Also present were Atiku Bagudu, Kebbi state governor; Lucky Irabor, the chief of defence staff; and Abdulrasheed Bawa, chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The meeting took place at the council chamber of the state house. Following the meeting, none of the parties in attendance agreed to speak with journalists. The CBN governor also declined to answer questions related to a possible amendment of the terms of the naira redesign policy. TheCable understands that an earlier scheduled meeting between the president and the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) was cancelled. The president was said to have cancelled the meeting because of a court decision prohibiting the federal government from extending the February 10, 2023 deadline for exchanging old naira notes. The president had on February 3 met with the All Progressives Congress (APC) governors over the naira redesign policy and its effects on Nigerians. During the meeting, the governors had asked Buhari to allow both the old and new notes to co-exist.
