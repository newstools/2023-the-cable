A monarch in Asamokwu village, Ndokwa East LGA of Delta, has been beheaded following a dispute over a derivation-sharing formula. Bright Edafe, the state police command spokesperson, confirmed the incident on Friday. Edafe said the monarch was killed on Thursday following an argument between his community and an adjoining village over the sharing formula of a derivation fund from an oil company situated in their environment. “The communities are having disputes over the derivation they got from the oil companies in that area. The two factions are having a disagreement over the sharing formula,” he said. “We believe that that was what led to the beheading of the community head. I can not confirm if soldiers and police officers are attacked, I am not aware of that one. TheCable also gathered that the incident has resulted in tension in the community. A source told PUNCH that the hoodlums that beheaded the monarch also ambushed four soldiers and killed three on the spot while others who sustained injuries were rushed to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba. “The hoodlums ambushed the Army personnel and killed three of them while others were rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba,” PUNCH quoted a source in the community.
