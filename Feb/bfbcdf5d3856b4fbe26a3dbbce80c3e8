Seven people are feared to have died following a clash involving supporters of political parties in Kano state. TheCable had earlier reported that some youths, who identified themselves as Kwankwasiyya supporter paraded through the streets of Kano state with machetes and sticks. Kwankwasiyya supporters are persons backing Rabiu Kwankwaso, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). An eyewitness told TheCable that one of the persons feared to have died in the clashes was set ablaze after he was accused of killing three persons. Several other people also reportedly sustained injuries, before the arrival of security operatives. Ibrahim Abdullahi, the spokesperson of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), told journalists that 63 persons found with “dangerous weapons” were arrested. “We have arrested about 63 suspected thugs disrupting public peace, wielding dangerous weapons, burning vehicles, and snatching handsets from people,” he said. “They are going to be investigated and taken to court for prosecution.” Sources told journalists that some local government officials and party members were also arrested but there has been no official confirmation on the development. Reacting to the incident, Garba Yusuf, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, denied claims that his party members were involved in the clashes. “APC is not involved in any way and we are not aware of what happened. On behalf of the campaign council, we condemn this act and we will write to the police to immediately investigate the action,” he said.
