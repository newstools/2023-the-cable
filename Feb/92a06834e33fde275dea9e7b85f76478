Moses Jolayemi, the presidential campaign coordinator of the Obi/Datti ticket in Ekiti, says Peter Obi, standard bearer of the LP, will win the presidential election if the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) is not compromised. Speaking with journalists on Saturday at a town hall meeting in Ado Ekiti, Jolayemi said if a free, fair, and credible election is conducted, Obi would win with a landslide. He said Nigerians were tired of the hardships brought to them by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Jolayemi alleged that Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the APC, has plans to buy votes. He advised that Tinubu and the APC should go on their knees and beg Nigerians for the suffering they brought to them, noting that the challenges caused by the naira redesign policy would soon be over. “If BVAS is allowed to work, we will have credible, violence free Election, if you look at the configuration of BVAS from the point of voting, collation, and announcing results there is no human intervention, with this, Peter Obi is the next President,” Jolayemi said. Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said the BVAS device cannot be manipulated because it automatically saves data without the operator pushing any button, adding that it has a system to deactivate any BVAS device if it is snatched during the election.
