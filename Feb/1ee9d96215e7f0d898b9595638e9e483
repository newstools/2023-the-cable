Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says Ademola Adeleke, governor of Osun, and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are “misbehaving” in the state. Speaking on Thursday at a rally in Osogbo, capital city of Osun, Tinubu said the APC administration of Gboyega Oyetola would soon return to continue its “good work”. Adeleke was declared winner of the governorship poll held on July 16, but Oyetola had claimed that there was overvoting in 749 polling units across 10 LGAs of the state. Oyetola’s argument was upheld by the Osun election petition tribunal and he was consequently declared the winner of the election in a judgment delivered on January 27. Amid the varied reactions to the verdict of the tribunal, Adeleke had advised residents of the state not to attend the APC presidential campaign rally over the “likelihood of violence”. In his remarks on Thursday, Tinubu accused the PDP of causing unrest in Osun. “They were given little opportunity to rule for some months and they started misbehaving, killing, and creating unrest in Osun state,” he said. Highlighting his plans for the state, Tinubu said he would support Osun to be a manufacturing and tourism paradise. “You have fertile soil, abundant mineral resources, and a rich culture and history capable of attracting tourists from across the world,” he said. “A vote for me is a vote to develop all parts of this state and this country. Rural areas will not be forgotten but will be developed to support more economic activities and create better lives for the people. “At the same time, our growing urban population – you city boys – will enjoy decent jobs and a living wage.” The former governor of Lagos also asked the residents not to vote for Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of PDP, because he did not make a positive impact when he was vice-president.
