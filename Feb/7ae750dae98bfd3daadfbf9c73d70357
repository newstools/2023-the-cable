The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has distanced itself from claims that the forthcoming elections may be postponed. There were claims earlier on Monday that the electoral body is considering shifting the date of the presidential election to March 4 over the ongoing naira note scarcity. A report had also quoted Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairperson, as saying the commission was affected by the cash shortage and that a postponement of the election would be in the best interest of Nigerians. Reacting to the claim, Rotimi Oyekanmi, spokesperson to the INEC chair, told TheCable that the claims are false. “It is not true. INEC will not, and is not even contemplating postponing the 2023 general election,” he said. “To be sure, the presidential/national assembly election will take place on 25th February, while the governorship/state assembly election will hold on 11th March 2023.” Meanwhile, TheCable had reported how Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said the apex bank would support INEC — including making cash available for logistics — to ensure the smooth conduct of the elections.
