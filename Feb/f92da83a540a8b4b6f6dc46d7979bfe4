The Osun state police command says it has arrested Olaleye Oluseyi, a fake Department of State Service (DSS) officer. Yemisi Opalola, the command’s spokesperson, said Oluseyi was arrested on January 15, following intelligence that he was parading himself as a DSS officer and duping people. Opalola said seven suspected kidnappers and three armed robbery suspects were also arrested. She said the suspects were arrested in various operations. “Operatives from the command surveillance unit immediately swung into action, arrested the suspect and he confessed to having duped one Taiwo Victor of the sum of N112,000, on the pretext of securing a DSS job for him,” she said. “When he was arrested, a face cap with the inscription of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) was also found in his possession.” Opalola said a 23-year-old female and two others were arrested for conspiracy and armed robbery. She said two of the suspects came to Osogbo from Lagos on January 28 and lodged in a hotel with the aid of the 23-year-old suspect. The spokesman said the suspects spied on their victims and robbed 20 students of the Federal Polytechnic Ede in their hostels. Opalola said they dispossessed their victims of 30 different brands of cell phones. She added that one Ojo Olowookere was also arrested on February 6 for attempting to steal a Bajaj motorcycle at Omowumi street, Fakunle area of Osogbo. The police spokesperson also said seven suspects who took part in kidnapping incidents in Ileogbo town, Iwo LGA, Kobongbogboe, and Otaefun area of Osogbo in January had been arrested. She said all the suspects would be charged in court after the completion of the investigation.
