Nnaemeka Ugboma, a judge and the chairman of the customary court in Ejemekwuru, Oguta LGA of Imo state, has been killed. The judge was shot dead when gunmen reportedly invaded the court during proceedings on Thursday. A source from the community told TheCable that the bandits came on motorcycles and proceeded to the courtroom where the judge was presiding. The incident ended the court proceeding as lawyers, court staff, and litigants scampered for safety. “The jurist hails precisely from Nnebukwu community in Oguta LGA. He was a law graduate of 1991 set. He was killed in his Court while delivering judgement,” the unnamed source said. “His killers came on motorcycles and came into the courtroom, dragged him out and shot him dead, and drove off. “His corpse was there as people in Court fled away. It was terrible. No one knew the reason why he was killed.” Ugochukwu, chairman of the Branch of the Nigerian Bar Association, confirmed the incident, adding that the association would communicate to the public on its actions regarding the incident. Henry Okoye, Imo Police Public Relations, did not comment as at the time of filing the report.
