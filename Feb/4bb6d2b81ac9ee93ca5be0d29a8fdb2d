A group known as the Concerned All Progressives Congress (APC) Stakeholders says the national working committee (NWC) of the party, led by Abdullahi Adamu, its national chairman, is “incompetent”. Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Saturday, Dominic Alancha, the group’s national coordinator, said the action of the party’s NWC has led to the defection of party members. Alancha said the party’s leadership has failed to raise funds for the presidential campaign of Bola Tinubu, the APC flagbearer. “Suffice it to say, this is perhaps the most incompetent NWC since the creation of this party. Very lacklustre and secretive,” he said. “At the last count, they had close to N38 billion from sales of forms and yet no accountability as to what they did with the money. They have bungled the primaries at the state level and angered many people which led to massive defection. “They have alienated major stakeholders of the party. “This is the first time in the history of political campaigns a ruling party failed in its responsibility to mobilize members and critical stakeholders of the party to raise campaign funds for the party; neither has it called for a NEC meeting to look into the wellbeing of the party and the campaign.” The coordinator said the implementation time of the new naira note policy by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is “horrible”. “It has plunged the country into a serious mess like we are witnessing with some pockets of protest across the country due to the inability of citizens to access the newly redesigned naira note, grounding the economy to a complete halt,” he said. “We fear if this continues it will lead to a complete and total breakdown of law and order.” Alancha said the apex bank should extend the deadline for the use of old naira notes by six months to ease the suffering of citizens.
