The All Progressives Congress (APC) has blamed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the alleged attack on the motorcade of President Muhammadu Buhari in Kano state. The president’s convoy was said to have been attacked in Kano during a visit to inaugurate projects on Monday. Stones were reportedly hurled at Buhari’s motorcade in the Hotoro area of the state. In reaction to the incident, PDP described the alleged incident as treason and sacrilege. “This organised attack on the person of the President is outrightly treasonable and a sacrilegious assault on our national sovereignty which must be condemned by all,” Debo Ologunagba, PDP spokesperson, had said. In a statement on Tuesday, Felix Morka, APC spokesman, said PDP’s comments on the purported attack on the motorcade of Buhari was a confession to commit a treasonable felony. “By actively instigating and sponsoring fringe violent and anti-social conduct by paid urchins during presidential engagements in Kano, the PDP has crossed the line of fair campaign engagement into grievous culpable criminality,” he said. “This is unacceptable and demands urgent law enforcement investigation and prosecution of all participants in this high crime. “Ostensibly, the PDP is morbidly terrified by the cozy and strong relations between our Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and President Muhammadu Buhari. As leader of our Party, President Buhari’s universe of goodwill and massive grassroots following inure to the benefit of our visionary Presidential Candidate. “The PDP is distraught and dejected by the bleak and irrecoverable hopelessness of its chances in the next general election. “However, that does not give it a right to incite and procure treasonable acts in desperate last-ditch and orchestrated plot to incite Nigerians against our party. The Nigerian electorate is smart, mature, sensible, and discerning.” Morka said Nigerians should vote for Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the APC.
