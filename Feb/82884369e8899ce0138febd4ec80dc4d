A group known as the Kaduna State Igbo Community Welfare Association has declared support for the governorship bid of Uba Sani, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking at an event on Sunday in Kaduna, Valentine Ewuzie, legal adviser of the association, said Sani, senator representing Kaduna central, is competent and qualified to hold office. Ewuzie said the senator has shown that he knows the Igbo people. “We have analyzed and assessed all the candidates and we can here and now, without mincing words, assure you that you are our candidate,” he said. “And being the most organized, we are going to employ it in making sure that you emerge as the next governor of this state.” He recalled that when Sani was an adviser to Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, he met with the Igbo community in the state and assured it of its safety. He praised Kaduna for abolishing the indigene/settler dichotomy, by recruiting professionals, including teachers, on merit. “It is also not in doubt that Kaduna state under your watch and the watch of His Excellency, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, is the only state that abolished the settler/indigene dichotomy in Nigeria as a whole,” Ewuzie said. “And you have given key roles to professionals and most especially the teachers in Kaduna state, by recruiting from all states of the federation on merit, without minding where they come from.” Responding, Sani assured that he would appoint an Igbo person to the state’s executive council if elected as governor.
