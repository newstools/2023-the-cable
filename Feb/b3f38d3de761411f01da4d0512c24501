The Ogun state police command says it has arrested one Michael Ogundele for allegedly shooting his younger sister’s boyfriend at Idiroko area of the state. In a statement on Sunday, Abimbola Oyeyemi, the state police spokesperson, said the suspect was arrested following a report lodged at Idiroko divisional headquarters by one Alpha Akeem, a community leader in Ihunbo town. Oyeyemi said Akeem came to the station with the injured victim and reported that the suspect shot the victim for refusing to stop having a love affair with his younger sister. “Upon the report, the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Idiroko Division, CSP Ayo Akinsowon, quickly mobilised his detectives to go after the suspect and he was subsequently arrested,” he said. “During interrogation, the suspect claimed to have warned the victim to desist from dating his younger sister but he refused. So, on that fateful day, he got information that the victim was sleeping in his sister’s room and he went there with a Dane gun. “On getting there, the victim jumped out from the window to escape when he was shot by the suspect.” Oyeyemi said the victim was quickly rushed to General Hospital, Idiroko, where he is currently responding to treatment. He added that Lanre Bankole, the state commissioner of police, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to the homicide section of the state criminal investigation departments for further investigation and possible prosecution.
