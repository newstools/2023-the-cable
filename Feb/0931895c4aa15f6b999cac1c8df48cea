The Niger state government has filed a suit against the federal government on the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Niger is the fifth state to sue the federal government on the controversial matter. Kaduna, Kogi, Zamfara and Kano had earlier filed legal action against the FG to stop the full implementation of the policy. In a statement on Saturday, Nasara Danmallam, Niger state’s attorney-general and commissioner for justice, said the suit marked SC/CV/210/2023 was filed before the supreme court on Friday. He said the suit “is seeking for an extension of the timeframe given by the CBN for the currency swap and withdrawal from circulation, the old N200, N500, and N1,000 amongst other reliefs”. In the affidavit in support of the originating summons, the Niger government contended that the unavailability of the newly redesigned notes has caused untold hardship and suffering for the residents of the state, especially those living in rural communities. The attorney-general said the state government is deeply concerned with the plight of residents and will continue to do anything within the constitutional limit to ameliorate their suffering. Following the decision of the supreme court which restrained the CBN from giving effect to the February 10 deadline, Nigerians are expected to continue using the old notes as legal tender until February 15. The federal government has however filed a preliminary objection to the suit, arguing that the supreme court lacks the requisite jurisdiction to entertain the matter. The court has fixed February 15 for hearing.
