Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, says President Muhammadu Buhari is in total support of Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The minister said the president’s campaign for the APC flagbearer is an indication of his support. Mohammed made the remark following a statement credited to Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna state. The governor had said that there are “elements” in the presidential villa who are working against the APC. In response, Mohammed on Wednesday said the government is not aware of the claim, adding that the focus of the Buhari administration is ensuring credible elections – a statement many interpreted to mean Tinubu did not have the backing of Buhari. Speaking at the 22nd edition of the administration’s scorecard series on Thursday in Abuja, the minister said it is “preposterous to even suggest that Mr President, who is the leader of our party, is equivocating on his support for our presidential candidate”. “Yesterday, while reacting to a question at the post-federal executive council briefing at the state house, I said, inter alia, that Mr President is committed to a free, fair and credible elections,” he said. “This comment has been misinterpreted in some circles, especially with regards to Mr President’s support for the presidential candidate of our party, the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “I want to say, unequivocally, that Mr President is in total support of our party’s flag bearer, and that is attested to by his continuing campaign with the candidate across the country. “I hope this clears any ambiguity that may have arisen from my statement yesterday.”
