Some yet-to-be-identified persons have razed Motailatu Church of God, Oke-Idahun Parish, in Akure south LGA of Ondo state. Briefing journalists about the incident on Sunday, David Akinadewo-Adekahunsi, the resident minister, said the footprints of the arsonists were detected when he got to the church premises on Friday evening. He said what caught his attention was the damaged lectern placed on the altar and some broken bottles that littered the church auditorium. Akinadewo-Adekahunsi said many plastic chairs belonging to the church and offering trays were set ablaze. He said hymn books and other items kept in a room in the uncompleted church building were not spared during what he called “the malicious damage brought upon the house of prayer”. Akinadewo-Adekahunsi added that the completed prayer room of the church was also torched by the attackers, as they damaged the window nets but could not gain access to the room. He, however, said the attackers succeeded in damaging the tithe box. The clergyman said the attack has been reported at the Oda divisional police headquarters, Akure, adding that he was assured that those behind the incident will be apprehended.
