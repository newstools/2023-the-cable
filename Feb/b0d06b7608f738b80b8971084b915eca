The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) says the new naira policy has worsened the healthcare situation in the country. Nigerians have been battling with cash scarcity as an adverse impact of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN )naira redesign policy. In the past few days, the development has led to protests and attacks on banks in some states. Speaking on Sunday during an interview with journalists, Ola Ahmed, Kwara state NMA chairman, said patients now find it difficult to access health services and drugs, due to lack of cash. “Patients are in a dire situation as they are unable to buy required drugs to stay alive,” NAN quoted him as saying. “A patient that is critically sick and cannot access money to pay for drugs is a terrible combination. “While the services of money transfer platforms tend not to work, some people use the opportunity to dupe others by sending fake transfer alerts.” Ahmed, however, said that the Kwara NMA would visit the management of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) and the Kwara State Hospital Management Board to discuss how best to tackle the situation to save lives. He said the association will also visit both government and private hospitals to find ways to tackle the situation. Also, Munirat Bello, the secretary of the Kwara Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), said pharmacists are trying to be as human as possible by giving drugs on credit, due to naira scarcity. “Patients who received drugs on credit can refund when they are able to,” she said. “But the risk is that some people don’t come back to pay. However, we will continue to engage with customers and patients to save lives.”
