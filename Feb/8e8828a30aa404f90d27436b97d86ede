The Police Service Commission (PSC) says it has suspended the promotion of eight police commissioners to the rank of assistant inspector general over the snub of the mandatory interview. The commission also suspended the promotion of 11 deputy commissioners of police to commissioners. The PSC took the decision at the end of its reconvened 18th plenary meeting which was held in Abuja, on Thursday and Friday. Ikechukwu Ani, PSC spokesperson, in a statement on Sunday, said the officers refused to honour the invitation by the commission to appear before it to “ascertain their suitability for the new offices”. “The commission suspended the promotion of eight commissioners of police to the rank of assistant inspectors general and eleven deputy commissioners of police to the next rank of commissioners due to their failure to appear before it for the mandatory promotion interview. “The commission had sent invitations to the officers to appear before it for the usual interaction to ascertain their suitability and capability for the new offices. “The commission expressed surprise on their failure to honour the invitation especially as the 2023 general elections are just days away.” Meanwhile, TheCable had earlier reported that the commission appointed three deputy inspectors general of police (DIG) and promoted 1,043 senior police officers to different ranks.
