Abba Umar Ganduje, an All Progressives Congress (APC) house of representatives candidate in Kano state, has distributed point of sale (POS) machines to youths. Abba, son of Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano, is seeking to represent Dawakin Tofa/Rimingado/Tofa federal constituency in the lower legislative chamber. If he wins, he would be replacing Tijjani Abdulkadir Jobe who is serving out his fourth term in office. He asked the youths to be good entrepreneurs and to mobilise support for Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the APC. The development comes amid the struggle by Nigerians in getting cash from banks. In October 2022, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), announced the plan to redesign the N200, N500, and N1,000 notes, and asked Nigerians to deposit their old notes before January 31, 2023, when they would cease to be legal tender. Although the deadline wasÂ extended to February 10, many Nigerians have found it difficult to obtain the new naira notes. TheCable had reported how the scarcity of cash has triggered protests across the country. Meanwhile, amid the scramble for cash, POS operators have jacked up their transaction charges.
