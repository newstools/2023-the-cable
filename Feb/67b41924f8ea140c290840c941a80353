The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Seme area command, says it has confiscated “fake $6 million notes” from suspects at the country’s border. Dera Nnadi, area controller of the command, announced the seizure during a media briefing on Thursday. Nnadi said the agency arrested two suspects over the development, adding that they were intercepted at the Gbaji checkpoint along the Seme corridor, on Tuesday. “Some of the anti-smuggling landmarks by the command include the seizure of fake $6m equivalent of N2.763 billion and the arrest of two suspects conveying the fake currency from Nigeria to the Republic of Benin,” he said. “Two male suspects were arrested in connection with the crime and are currently in our custody pending prosecution. “The arrest was made at Gbaji checkpoint along the Seme corridor on January 31, 2023.” In another related development, Nnadi said the agency seized 39,000 litres of petroleum in jerry cans along the creeks, which had duty paid value (DPV) of N9,366,350. “Other items seized include 55 sacks containing 550 pieces of donkey skin with a DPV of N11,371,511 only,” he added. “The significance of the seizure is that it shows how much our endangered species are being eroded by unpatriotic elements. “These achievements so far were not made on a platter of gold. It took the painstaking efforts of the officers who spent hours on patrol and surveillance to record the seizures.”
