Sanusi Dantata, an entrepreneur, has complained of a reduction in customers’ purchase of eggs. In a tweet on Wednesday, Dantata attributed the low patronage to the poor implementation of naira redesign policy. The naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which has been followed by scarcity of naira notes, has led to protests in parts of the country. TheCable had reported that the supreme court adjourned judgment in the suit challenging the naira redesign policy to March 3. The entrepreneur, who is the son of Abdulkadir Dantata, late business tycoon, said his store produces about 500 crates of eggs every day. He said that sales have drastically dropped despite accepting online cash transfers as well as old naira notes from customers. Dantata also said the prices of the eggs have been slashed by more than 20 percent as a tactic to attract customers and boost sales. “We all are suffering for the sins of a few!
Thanks to the naira redesign Policy, and subsequent downturn in economic activities, see how our eggs dey pile! Our store and floor are full. We must continue to Feed our Birds! Meanwhile, people aren’t buying! God will see us through!” the tweet reads. “We accept transfer of course. We even accept Old Naira! The Naira Redesign Policy has created chaos in the economy, which you might have heard about. People aren’t buying stuff. Some are unable to buy stuff.” We all are suffering for the sins of a few! Thanks to the Naira Redesign Policy, and subsequent downturn in economic activities, see how our eggs dey pile! Our store and floor are full. We must continue to Feed our Birds!
