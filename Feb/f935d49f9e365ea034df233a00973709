Alice Nderitu, the United Nations (UN) under-secretary-general and special adviser on the prevention of genocide, says the use of hate speech has increased in Nigeria due to digital technology. According to a statement by Oluseyi Soremekun, UN national information officer, Nderitu said this on Friday during a media briefing held at the UN office in Abuja. She said all harmful speeches “begin with words”, adding that it is crucial to prevent the provocative use of language as it can trigger violence. Nderitu also said “actions aimed at countering and addressing hate speech must be at the heart of all prevention efforts”. “Countering and addressing hate speech is crucial. By addressing divisive and harmful language, we can avoid escalation of tensions that could result in violence. Measures to that effect can also help build societies that are resilient and inclusive,” she said. “Election season in Nigeria had witnessed a surge in the use of inflammatory language, hateful and divisive rhetoric, and such hate speech was amplified at an unprecedented rate by digital technology. “We know that the impact of hate speech makes those targeted more vulnerable to violence, exposes them to exclusion and discrimination, exacerbates underlying social and economic inequalities, and undermines social cohesion, “We know too that hate speech particularly impacts women differently as is often evidenced by their absence from political spaces. It also contributes to polarising communities along identity lines, hampering dialogue and reconciliation.” She urged the media to create awareness, educate Nigerians on situations at risk, and also expose false narratives using verified facts.
