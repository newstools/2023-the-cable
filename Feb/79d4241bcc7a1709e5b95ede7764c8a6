Dele Momodu, director of strategic communications of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council, says it will be “almost impossible” for Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) to win the presidential election. Speaking on Thursday when he featured on an Arise Television Programme, Momodu said Atiku Abubakar, candidate of the PDP, has the best chance to win among the presidential candidates. “I know it will be almost impossible for him to win but I am not God,” he said. “You see, the configuration of Nigeria is what has convinced me that Atiku has the best chance. “The history of Nigeria has also convinced me that history is still repeating itself like it did in 1979, in 1983, when we had Chief Obafemi Awolowo in the south-west. “We had Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe in the south-east; we had Shagari from the north-west; we had Baba Aminu Kano in Kano; just like we have Kwankwaso today. So, it’s a repeat. “Whenever two strong southern candidates meet a main northern candidate, it is impossible to beat them. “So, today, the competition is between Asiwaju and Peter Obi; it is not with Atiku Abubakar. That is a theory that held then, that holds today, and will still hold tomorrow.”
