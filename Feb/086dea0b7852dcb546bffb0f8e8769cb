Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), has condemned the killing of Oyibo Chukwu, the party’s candidate for Enugu east senatorial district. Chukwu was reportedly killed and set ablaze at Amechi Awkunanaw in Enugu south LGA on Wednesday after gunmen opened fire on his convoy. Five of his supporters who were with him were also killed. Reacting to the incident on Thursday, Obi described the killing as “mindless bloodletting”, and urged the security agencies to be swift in bringing the perpetrators to justice. In a statement by Diran Onifade, his media aide, the LP candidate said residents of the south-east should not be “frightened away” from participating in the election. “I strongly condemn the killing of Barrister Chukwu in all its entirety. Human lives must remain precious, irrespective of political affiliation. The mindless bloodletting that occurs in the nation is beyond depressing. We must not continue to toe this dangerous path,” he said. “Enough of the killings, now is the time for healing. I sincerely condole with the bereaved family, the Enugu east senatorial zone, and our dear Labour party family for this painful loss. “I call on the law enforcement agents to fish out and bring to the book. “I’m making it clear that the activities of evil men like the killers of Chukwu do not represent the character of Igbos and Nigerians as a whole.”
