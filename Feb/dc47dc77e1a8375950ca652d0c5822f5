The Kogi government says an order of court forfeiting 14 properties allegedly linked to the state is a “joke” by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The federal high court in Lagos granted the interim forfeiture order of 14 properties following an ex parte application by the EFCC. The 14 properties are said to be located in Lagos, Abuja, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In a statement on Wednesday, Kingsley Fanwo, Kogi commissioner for information, said the anti-graft agency has declared a “tactless” open war against the state government. “EFCC’s forfeiture joke is clearly a desperate concoction of confused, unintelligent officials,” Fanwo said. “Nigerians, and indeed, the international community are not as ignorant as the convicted Bawa and his sponsors. They know, with the different onslaughts against the Kogi State Government, and its officials, that this is clear persecution by a desperate and power drunk EFCC. “In due course, Nigerians will confirm that the EFCC, under Bawa, is the capital of corruption amongst agencies in Nigeria. “Unlike the convicted Bawa, who has no regard for the courts, we want to state clearly here that from what we have read in the media, not one we witnessed, this is a forfeiture proceeding and the order is an order of interim forfeiture, which gives persons who allegedly own the properties rights to come to court to establish their ownership of the said properties. We will follow through with the courts. “For now, it is clear the EFCC has declared a tactless open war against the Kogi State Government, owing mainly to the Governor’s unflinching loyalty to the All Progressives Congress and not individuals. “We will prove our innocence in court. It is a matter of time.”
