Paul Enenche, the senior pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre (DIGC), has declared his support for Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP). He announced his decision in a post on his social media handles on Monday. The post was accompanied with a photograph of him, Obi, and David Oyedepo, the founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide. “A picture they say, is worth a thousand words. This picture was randomly taken by a photographer sometime ago but is speaking volumes right now, especially in this season,” Enenche wrote. “What do you see? What can you hear? Are you in doubt of the way to go? The way of integrity, authenticity, honesty, sincerity, simplicity, humility, capacity, productivity; here is the way to go.” This picture is speaking volumes right now,especially in this season.
