The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it is investigating the circumstances surrounding its Twitter account liking a post relating to a presidential candidate. On Wednesday, INEC’s official Twitter account liked a post in which Seun Kuti, son of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, criticised Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP). Kuti, in the post, described the LP candidate “an opportunist that can’t deliver Nigeria”. The incident caused the commission to come under heavy criticism with many Twitter users accusing INEC of bias. But the commission, in a statement reacting to the incident, maintained its neutrality and said it has no preferred candidate. It added that it is investigating the matter and will take disciplinary actions if needed. “The attention of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been drawn to a post on its Twitter handle, liking a post relating to one of the 18 Presidential candidates,” the statement reads. “The Commission is an independent electoral body and does not have preference for any candidate or political party. The Commission assures all Nigerians of its neutrality and will conduct a general election that is free and fair to all. The allegiance of the Commission is to the people of Nigeria. “In the meantime, the Commission is investigating the circumstances that led to the liking of the said post and will take appropriate disciplinary actions if an infraction is established.”
