Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, has asked President Muhammadu to respect the ruling of the supreme court on the old naira notes. Wike spoke on Friday at the Rivers campaign rally flag-off in Ngo town, Andoni LGA of the state. On Thursday, Buhari said he has directed the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to extend the validity of old N200 notes till April 10. The president also said all existing old N1,000 and N500 notes will remain redeemable at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and designated points for 60 days. Buhari gave the directive despite the supreme court ruling that the old notes remain legal tender pending the determination of a case filed by some state governors. On Wednesday, the supreme court said its order on the old notes stands and ruling on the matter was adjourned till February 22. Speaking on the development, Wike said  he is against the naira redesign policy because it has brought suffering to the people. “I believe in a country that respects the rule of law. The president ought to respect the supreme court and when you do not respect the supreme court, then it is anarchy you are talking about,” Wike said. “So, we from Rivers state condemn the position of Mr President for not respecting the decision of the supreme court. “We want democracy and there cannot be democracy without the rule of law. Therefore, any candidate who is in support of the policy when the people are suffering, we will not support that candidate. “Any policy you have to implement, you have to weigh it because you [were] put there for the people. If your policy is going to suffer the people, then think twice.”
