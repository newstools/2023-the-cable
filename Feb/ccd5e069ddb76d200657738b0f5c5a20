Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere, Yoruba socio-political group, says Bola Tinubu’s claim that it is his turn to be president is an agreement between the latter and President Muhammadu Buhari. Adebanjo spoke on Saturday, at the presidential rally of the Labour Party (LP) which held at the Tafawa Balewa Square in Lagos state. The term ’emi lo kan’ became popular when Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said it was his turn to become president. “Don’t let us turn our campaign to that of those that sing. We have come to work. We want to take the area boys from the streets and get them employed,” Adebanjo said. “I said it somewhere that if Obi does not come in as the president, forget Nigeria. The northern elders said I want to impose Obi on them. No! They want to impose a northerner on us but we say no! “And the one that said it is their turn, it’s between him and Buhari. “‘Emi lo kan’ does not mean it’s the turn of the Yoruba. ‘Emi lo kan’ is between him and Buhari — that when Buhari leaves, he will become his successor. Were you there when he said that? “Presidency should be rotated. Yoruba had their turn when Obasanjo was in power. After him, Yar’Adua came into power. Then Jonathan. Then it went back to the north and Buhari came into power. “We have had our turn. Now, are we supposed to be there again?” Adebanjo also said it was time Nigerians took matters into their hands and vote for their rights. He enjoined all to go out en masse and vote in the forthcoming election, protect their votes, and prevent rigging.
