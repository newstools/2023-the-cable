Julius Abure, national chairman of the Labour Party (LP), has presented Beatrice Itubo as the party’s governorship candidate in Rivers state. While presenting Itubo on Monday, Abure called on residents of Rivers to vote for her as the next governor of the state. Before the presentation, there has been controversey as to who the governorship candidate of the party in the state is. Fafaa Princewill had declared himself as the governorship candidate of the party. But the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has recognised Itubo as the party’s flagbearer in the state. Members of Princewill’s camp had alleged that his name was submitted to INEC following a February 2 court judgement that recognised him as the candidate. However, the LP chairman on Monday, called on the residents to vote for Itubo to prove a point. “Let us prove a point. Rivers State is Obidient. It will be easier for us to prove that we won Rivers State in the presidential election if we win it again in the gubernatorial election,” Abure said. “Do not be deceived by the PDAPC’s affliction that you should vote for them. It’s a ploy to make regaining our mandate more difficult. “A vote for our governor is a vote for our mandate as represented by Peter Obi.”
