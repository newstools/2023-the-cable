The United Nations has condemned the killing of over 30 civilians in Mukdolo village in Ngala LGA, Borno state. TheCable reported that not less than 26 fishermen were reportedly killed by suspected fighters of the Islamic State’s West African Province (ISWAP). The militants invaded the village in their numbers on Wednesday, torturing their victims before killing them. In a statement on Thursday, Matthias Schmale, UN resident and humanitarian coordinator, said the attack is a reminder of the sufferings faced by residents in the 13 years of armed conflict in Nigeria’s northern region. “The United Nations strongly condemns the reported ambush and brutal killing of more than 30 civilians in Mukdolo village in Ngala Local Government Area in Borno State yesterday,” the statement reads. “Several people were also reportedly injured, and others are still missing following the deadly attack allegedly carried out by an armed group. “On behalf of the United Nations, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and wish the injured who are recuperating a speedy recovery. “The victims of this heinous attack were fishermen and farmers eking out a livelihood in a very insecure environment. They included both internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host community members from the neighbouring Dikwa Local Government Area. “This deeply shocking attack is another horrific reminder of the real threats of violence and insecurity that IDPs and other people affected by more than 13 years of the non-international armed conflict in the region continue to face daily in their struggle to survive. The village of Mukdolo had been abandoned prior to the attack due to the activities of non-state armed groups. “I remind all parties to the conflict to adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law to protect civilians from harm.” He called on state authorities to investigate the crime and swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice.
