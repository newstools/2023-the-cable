A train has collided with a passenger bus in the Shogunle area of Oshodi in Lagos state. The incident took place on Thursday morning. Witnesses at the scene said the bus was attempting to cross the rail track when an oncoming train rammed into it. The train reportedly dragged the bus from Shogunle to the PWD area of Ikeja. Several passengers were said to be injured in the accident. The Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) confirmed that the bus was conveying staff of the Lagos state government to the office. “Report confirmed there are casualties and effort is on to rescue victims to the nearest hospital,” LASTMA said. The agency added that officials are on the scene to “do the needful”. Ibrahim Farinloye, a spokesperson for the National Emergency Management Agency in Lagos, said two female staff of the state government died in the accident. “On arrival of the agency’s response team at the scene of the incident, it was discovered that a Viale BRT bus with an unknown registration number and a train was involved in an accident at the above-mentioned address,” he said. “Investigation gathered revealed that the immediate cause of the incident was due to reckless driving on the part of the BRT bus driver while trying to beat the train traffic signal before the moving train rammed into the BRT bus. “Unfortunately, two adults were confirmed dead and several people seriously injured. “The injured victims have been administered first aid treatment by the agency’s medical team (paramedics) and LASAMBUS officials, well stabilized and being transported to the trauma centre at LASUTH Ikeja for further treatment.”
