Bode George, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says he has not abandoned his plan to leave the country once Bola Tinubu becomes president of Nigeria. George spoke in an interview with Punch on Sunday. Last week, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced Bola Tinubu, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as the winner of the presidential election. Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, said Tinubu polled 8,794,726 votes. Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had the second-highest figure with 6,984,520 votes, while Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) was next with 6,101,533 votes. Prior to the election, George had, at least five times, vowed to leave Nigeria if Tinubu was elected into the number one job in the country. Speaking on his promise in the latest interview, the PDP chieftain said although he is yet to decide on his destination, his self-imposed exile remains in the works. George added that he plans to retire to “anywhere in any part of the world” because Tinubu’s victory “might be a hell of a problem”. “That is still on my plan. If I decide on what to do, I wish you well. I’m not looking for a job, I have everything I want and how much can I eat? I also have my children and they are no longer kids,” he said. “They are all mature so what am I looking for? My wife is there. She will take good care of me. I will stay in Nigeria depending on the outcome of this[post-election litigation] because I know there might be a hell of a problem. “You know I am a military lord so I can go anywhere in any part of the world and I will be looking at you people. “I have even decided that having put 25 years each in the military and politics which is 50 years of my life in the public domain, I need rest so whatever I see at the end of this thing. I’m retiring from partisan politics and will be enjoying the rest of my life.”
