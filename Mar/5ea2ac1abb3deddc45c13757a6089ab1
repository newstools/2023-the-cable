The Flying Eagles of Nigeria have suffered a 1-0 loss to the Gambia in the semi-final of the ongoing U20 African Cup of Nations (AFCON). Adama Bojang’s early goal had the ultimate say in halting Nigeria’s chase for its eighth U20 continental crown. The Flying Eagles had already qualified for the U20 World Cup following their win over Uganda in the quarter-final, but the team failed to maintain the momentum against the Gambian at the Cairo International Stadium on Monday. The Nigerians had barely settled into the game when a defensive mix-up by Daniel Bameyi set up Bojang who slotted the ball beyond Chijioke Aniagboso. The Flying Eagles kept fighting for an equalizer thereon. Benjamin Frederick’s double effort was blocked by a defender and grabbed by the Gambian goalkeeper. The Nigerians were awarded a penalty kick deep into the second half, but Ahmed Abdullahi’s strike from the spot was smashed against the upright. Two minutes into added time, Onuche Ogbelu also sent an ambitious long-range shot from the edge of the Gambians’ goal area but it failed to trouble anyone. Gambia will face take on Senegal in the competition’s final on Saturday while Nigeria play Tunisia in the third-place match earlier in the day.
