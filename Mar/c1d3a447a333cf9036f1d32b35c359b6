Enoch Adeboye, general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), says God will soon deliver the common man from powerful people making life miserable for them. In a sermon on Sunday, Adeboye said some people in positions of power make life difficult and cause havoc for ordinary people. “At the beginning of this year, the Almighty God said that some balloons will burst,” he said. “I am looking forward to seeing those balloons burst because there are some people who are making life miserable for the common man. “They have the power to do so, and they are in a position to wreak havoc on people. “They are using that power to make the common man miserable. Some balloons need to burst. By the time God finished with Nebuchadnezzar, he knew who was the most high God”. Adeboye further stated that those who attempt to stop the spread of the gospel “would be eaten by worms”. “I can say with confidence, anyone who tries to stand in the way of the spreading of the gospel of Jesus Christ, worms will eat them up,” he said. “The heavens will open and the mighty hands of the Almighty God will come down and hit some people, point them out to worms.”
