President-elect Bola Tinubu says his wife, Oluremi, a former senator, will play the role of a housewife when he assumes office. Earlier on Wednesday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had announced Tinubu as the president-elect after he won the presidential election. While giving his acceptance speech, Tinubu said senators should not expect his wife back in the red chamber. “To my lovely wife, Oluremi Tinubu, you the senators should not expect her back. She is going to be my housewife and first lady,” Tinubu said. Oluremi is a Nigerian senator who started representing Lagos central senatorial district in 2011 after her time as the first lady from 1999 to 2007. In 2015, she became one of the six women elected into the red chamber, while in 2021, she received the award for the most impactful female senator at the Guardian-organised International Women’s Day Summit. One of her highlights in the senate was when she proposed a bill to reform the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST), in 2021, in order to make it a more viable entity.
