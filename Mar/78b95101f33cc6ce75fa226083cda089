The Enugu chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has denied planning to rig the governorship election in the state. Frank Nweke, All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) governorship candidate, had alleged that the PDP is planning to disrupt the March 11 election. Nweke said the PDP has made plans to influence officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to bypass the bimodal voter accreditation system (BVAS) machines. Reacting via a statement issued by Nana Ogbodo, Enugu PDP campaign council spokesperson, the party said Nweke is only making “preposterous conjectures”. “We would ordinarily not dignify Nweke with a response because his impact on the forthcoming general elections begins and ends with congesting and making the ballot papers longer than necessary,” the statement reads. “He is therefore only laying the formwork of excuses for his expected abysmal outing in the governorship poll. Nweke went into APGA ostensibly on the wrong permutation that PDP’s governorship ticket would go outside Nkanu land so he could harvest from the expected anger of the people. Unfortunately for him, events mocked his foresight as that was not to be. “We therefore advise Nweke to climb down from this high horse and first present himself for a popularity test in his hometown, Ozalla, before pursuing an illusionary governorship ambition. “We also reckon that Nweke, who has been a senior stakeholder and a major beneficiary of successive PDP governments until March 2022 when he embarked on his delusional governorship voyage on the platform of APGA will ultimately return to the umbrella after his crushing defeat on March 11.”
