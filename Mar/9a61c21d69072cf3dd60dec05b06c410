Olajide Adediran, governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos, says the state needs a governor that is independent and can think for himself. Adediran, better known as Jandor, said for Lagos to attain its full potential, a governor that doesn’t “require second-level approval to get things done” must be elected. He spoke on Wednesday in an interview with Chude Jideonwo, the media personality. “For me, I don’t want to be that governor that will require second-level approval to get things done, because the ones you are having can’t do anything on their own. Ambode, Sanwo-Olu, and even Fashola,” he said. “These are good men, but being a good man is not enough. We need an independent governor, one who can think for himself and make good his promises to the people.” Reacting to the ‘agbero’(thugs) situation in the state, Adediran said the problem stems from the types of policies being made by the leadership of the state. He said the thugs who are found culpable in this situation are instruments used by the leadership of the state to rig elections and intimidate people. “When people come to tell me, Agbero is terrorizing us in Lagos, I say ‘No’, it is not Agbero that is terrorizing us, it is our government that is terrorizing us because if they want Agberos to stop in Lagos today, it will stop,” he said. “It is their own policy that is bringing Agberos out and making Lagos unrest for people. They have intimidated people from joining the process and they take over all the polling units. “If you win at the polling unit, they change it at the collation centre, but with the BVAS and the electronic transmission, you will see the beating that APC will take in this election.” Adediran is contesting against Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the incumbent governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as well as Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour of the Labour Party (LP).
