Mike Igini, a former resident electoral commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Akwa Ibom, says the bimodal voter accreditation system (BVAS) functioned optimally in the presidential election. Since the February 25 elections, many Nigerians have expressed concerns over the performance of the BVAS. During the election coverage, TheCable observed that in several polling units, glitches on the BVAS delayed the voting process. INEC had extended the voting time till 4pm in some places to make up for the time lost. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) cited the BVAS failure as one of the factors that affected the efficiency of the election procedure. Commenting on the concerns during an Arise TV interview on Tuesday, Igini said it is incorrect to say BVAS failed. The former INEC REC said findings from an ongoing review of previous elections showed that the BVAS significantly reduced exaggerated figures from being uploaded. “The BVAS as I said and I will repeat and reiterate here, that the BVAS functioned, the BVAS delivered, the BVAS won,” Igini said. “It’s grossly incorrect to suggest that BVAS failed at the just concluded presidential election.” Igini added that the BVAS put an end to the “invidious figures that were posted in several parts of the country” in previous elections.
