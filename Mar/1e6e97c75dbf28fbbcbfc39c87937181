Gunmen have killed Ogbonnaya Ugwu, the councillor of Echara Ward 2 in Okposi community, Ohaozara LGA in Ebonyi state. According to NAN, a resident said the councillor was killed at a relaxation point while returning from his shop. The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), in a statement by Charles Otu, its spokesperson, condemned the murder of the councillor. “We in APGA Ebonyi Campaign Council strongly condemn the murder. This is another senseless killing of a vibrant Ebonyi youth,” NAN quoted Otu as saying. “While we sincerely sympathise with the family of the deceased, our campaign council charges the government to unravel the killers. “We are aware that there had been several shootings by unidentified gunmen, especially at night in Okposi and in many other communities in the state. “No stone should be left unturned to apprehend and bring to book, this murderous gang that has been terrorising Okposi, Ohaozara and the entire state.” The Ebonyi police command confirmed the killing of the councillor. Onome Onovwakpoyeya, spokesperson of the Ebonyi police command, said an investigation into the incident has commenced to track the killers and bring them to book.
