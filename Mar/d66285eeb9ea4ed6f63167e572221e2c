The Bauch police command say they have killed two suspected kidnappers and rescued a victim in Rafin Gora, Ningi LGA in the state. Ahmed Wakil, the state police spokesperson, confirmed the development to TheCable on Sunday. Wakil said police operatives were mobilised to the scene when they got reports of gunmen invading a resident’s home and attempting to kidnap his son. He said an exchange of gunfire between the police and the kidnappers resulted in the death of two of the suspects while one AK47 was recovered from them. He added that the victim was shot multiple times as he attempted to escape but was immediately taken to the Federal Medical Centre at Birnin Kudu for treatment. “He is recuperating and responding well to treatment,” the police spokesperson said. Search has begun for the fleeing suspects.
