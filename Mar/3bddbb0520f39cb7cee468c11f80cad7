The police command in Oyo says its operatives have arrested two suspected members of a secret cult over  alleged murder of a resident. The police said the suspects are members of the eiye confraternity responsible for armed robberies and killing of innocent people in Oyo town and its environs. Speaking during the parade of the suspects in Ibadan, Adewale Osifeso, Oyo police spokesperson, said the suspects, Najeem Rildwan and  Odeyemi Maleek, murdered one Jimoh Akeem at Okun compound, Molete, on Monday. “The complainant managed to escape from the attack, but the deceased who shared his apartment and was sleeping at the time was not able to escape and was gruesomely murdered,” Osifeso said. “The assailants vandalised properties in the house and fled with some valuable items.” The police spokesperson said the suspects confessed to the crime and also to the fact that they belonged to the eiye confraternity. Speaking with newsmen, one of the suspects said the deceased belonged to a rival cult gang that attacked members of his confraternity. “Eight of us later went to meet them where they normally sleep and killed one of them with a machete,” the suspect said. “Five out of the eight people that went for the operation went inside the house and killed the victim.”
