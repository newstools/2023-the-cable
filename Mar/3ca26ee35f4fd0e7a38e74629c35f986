The Lagos police command says five out of 23 persons arrested during the presidential and national assembly elections will be arraigned for electoral offences. Benjamin Hundeyin, the command’s spokesperson, said the investigation showed that only five of them have cases to answer in court for allegedly disrupting the electoral process on February 25. “Out of 23 persons arrested during presidential and parliamentary elections, five of them will be charged to court any moment from now for disrupting the electoral process,” Hundeyin said. “Their investigations have been concluded. The rest are just victims of circumstances.” Last Monday, Idowu Owohunwa, Lagos commissioner of police, assured residents that those arrested and culpable for electoral crimes would be charged in court this week. Owohunwa gave the assurance at a stakeholders’ meeting to review the security of the presidential and national assembly elections.
