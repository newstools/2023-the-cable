The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it will conduct supplementary polls for some national assembly elections after March 11. The governorship and state house of assembly elections are billed to take place on March 11. INEC, in a statement signed by Festus Okoye, national commissioner, said it is aware of issues in some senatorial districts and federal constituencies. “The Commission is compiling the list of the affected constituencies. A date for supplementary elections will be fixed after the Governorship and State Assembly elections,” the statement reads. “The Commission assures Nigerians that the Governorship and State House of Assembly elections scheduled for Saturday 11th March 2023 will hold as scheduled and all the processes and procedures leading to the election are being finalized.” INEC also assured that it would conduct the pending elections in Enugu east senatorial district, Esan-central/Esan-west and Igueben federal constituencies in Edo state on March 11. The electoral body had postponed elections in Esan and Igueben federal constituency in Edo state because a party’s logo was missing on the ballot paper. INEC conducted the presidential and national assembly elections nationwide on February 25. Bola Tinubu, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was declared the winner of the election. The commission said it would release a statement to announce when winners of the national assembly polls will be presented with their certificates of return.
