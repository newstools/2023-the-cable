Festus Keyamo, spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council, says Peter Obi, candidate of the Labour Party (LP), could not have won the presidential election because he is a “fragment” of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). On Wednesday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Bola Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate, as the winner of the election. The commission announced that Tinubu secured 8,794,726 votes to defeat Atiku Abubakar of the PDP who got 6,984,520 votes and Obi who polled 6,101,533 votes. Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Thursday, Obi rejected the results, saying he won the election and would prove it in court. In a subsequent statement, Keyamo alleged that Obi played the most divisive politics in the country’s history. “Mr. Peter Obi knows he could not have won, having played the most divisive religious politics in our history and the pattern of the votes clearly shows that,” he said. “Mr. Obi knows he could not have won, having broken out as a fragment of the main opposition, the PDP and all he could hope for was to harvest a portion of the votes of PDP in a section of the country and the results do not tell a lie. “Mr. Obi knows he could not have won when he presented himself as a tribal candidate and was only campaigning in settlements of his tribesmen in other states outside the south-east instead of appealing to all and sundry. “Mr. Obi knows he could not have won having joined the Labour Party few months ago and bought the ticket of the Party without valid Primaries and thereby polarized his party; Mr. Peter Obi knows he did not win because he did not even fulfill the minimum requirement of our constitution which requires a spread of 25 percent in two-thirds of the states of the federation. “He did not even come close. With his divisive rhetoric, he could not have come close.”
