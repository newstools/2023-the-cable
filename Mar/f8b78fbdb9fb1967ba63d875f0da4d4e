Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says it is not true that he vowed “to fight and bleed to death” to claim his mandate. Valentine Obienyem, media adviser to Obi, said in a statement on Friday, that the LP candidate urged his supporters to remain calm and be prayerful about the events that are happening in the country. Obienyem said the former governor of Anambra also said his supporters should ignore the news where he was quoted as saying that “he never lost an election; that he would fight and “bleed to death until” his mandate is restored; that he would drag “INEC until there will be no life left in them”; that he was “looking forward to jailing all that partook in this scam and fraud called election, among others”. He said Obi described “the news as not only false but also mischievous, misleading and out of character”. Obienyem reiterated that the LP candidate “would continue to pursue the recovery of the stolen mandate through the legal process”. “I have worked through similar paths in the past and was successful. I shall follow the same path without endangering the relative peace in the country, which is actually what those election riggers are striving desperately to upset,” Obi was quoted as saying. TheCable reported that Obi cancelled gubernatorial campaign trips across states in the country to head to court to fight for his mandate. On March 1, Mahmood Yakubu, chairperson of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), announced Bola Tinubu, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as the winner of the election with 8,794,726 votes. Atiku had 6,984,520 votes while Obi polled 6,101,533 votes. The opposition candidates have expressed their intention to challenge the result in court.
