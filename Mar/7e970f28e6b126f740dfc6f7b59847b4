Fidet Okhiria, managing director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), says the driver is to be blamed for the accident involving a train and a bus in Lagos on Thursday. A train collided with a bus conveying staff of the Lagos government with two people confirmed dead. Witnesses at the scene said the bus was attempting to cross the rail track when the oncoming train rammed into it. The train reportedly dragged the bus from Shogunle to the PWD area of Ikeja. Several passengers were said to be injured in the accident. Speaking on the incident in a chat with NAN, Okhiria said the driver attempted to cross the rail tracks and beat the train. He urged Lagos drivers to be careful when driving through the level crossing. “According to the information I gathered at the scene of the incident, they said many cars stopped when they got to the level crossing while the Lagos State Staff Bus driver continued moving, which I don’t know why,” the NRC boss said. “Maybe the driver thought he could pass before the train got nearer to him. He could not pass, and then the train crushed the bus; that is what we gathered. “The train was coming from Ijoko to Iddo.” Meanwhile, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, has expressed sadness over the incident. In a tweet, he thanked “well-meaning Lagosians” who immediately joined in rescue efforts and extended his condolences to the families of the victims. “I am deeply saddened by the news of the train/bus accident. The vehicle was conveying staff of the Lagos state government, our staff who serve the state in different capacities. Let’s say a prayer for the families and a prayer of mercy and protection for our state,” the tweet reads “My thoughts are with the victims and their families during this difficult time. A big thank you to well-meaning Lagosians who immediately joined in rescue efforts. Our first responders and emergency services are on ground and we will share more information shortly.”
