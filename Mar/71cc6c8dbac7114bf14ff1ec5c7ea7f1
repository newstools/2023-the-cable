The Ebonyi chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on youths in the state to steer clear of violence during the March 11 governorship and the house of assembly polls. Kelechukwu Igwe, director of youth mobilisation, PDP campaign council in Ebonyi, spoke on Tuesday at a news conference in Abakaliki, the state capital. Igwe called on the youths to come out en masse to vote for credible candidates but warned them not to fight in the process. “We urge all eligible voters in Ebonyi, especially the youths, to turn out en-masse to cast their votes on March 11,” NAN quoted him as saying. “Vote, but don’t fight. Vote for credible candidates; vote for capacity and for candidates that have the fear of God. “Ebonyi people should wake up and follow who knows roads for better Ebonyi,’’ he said. Igwe decried the level of violence that occurred during the presidential and national assembly elections in the state, adding that it had become expedient for him to address the general public on the matter. He said there was the need to play the election game by the rules and charged politicians to respect and obey the electoral laws. “We are saying no to rigging and to manipulation of elections results. We call on INEC to resist every form of compromise and not allow its operatives to be used by politicians,” he said. “We must respect and obey the electoral laws to achieve free, fair, and credible elections on March 11.” Igwe also called on security agents to step up operations at polling units in Ebonyi’s 171 wards to protect voters and their votes and ensure that the rightful voters were not disenfranchised.
