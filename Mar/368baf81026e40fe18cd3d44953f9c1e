Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers state, says the defection of Eric Apia, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) into the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), is an “electoral fortune”. Kelvin Ebiri, special assistant on media to Wike, said in a statement on Tuesday that the governor spoke at a brief reception in Ehuda town, Ahoada east LGA of the state. The event was organised to receive Apia, who until his defection, was the leader of the APC in Ahoada east LGA and the party’s house of representatives candidate in the February 25 elections. Wike said Apia’s defection is a great opportunity for the PDP ahead of the gubernatorial election on March 11. The governor noted that the former opposition politician is a formidable grassroots leader whose exit from the party marked the eventual death of the party. He said more votes would be secured for the PDP since Apia’s supporters have also pledged their loyalty, and were willing to deliver votes for Siminialayi Fubara, the PDP governorship candidate, on Saturday. Governor Wike expressed delight over the union that has made them one political family and assured the they would work together for the development of Ekpeye kingdom and the state in general. Responding, Apia said he would bring on board the same political enthusiasm with which he worked for the APC to the PDP to ensure its victory in the upcoming polls.
