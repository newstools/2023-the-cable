The Plateau police command says it has arrested an inspector identified as Solomon Damak for shooting Nyommena Salah, a resident of the state, over an argument. NAN reports that Alfred Alabo, police spokesperson in the state, said both men were arguing over the elections when the incident happened. Alabo said the victim resides in the Tudun Wada community of Jos north LGA in Plateau. He said the victim sustained injuries from the gunshot but did not die, adding that he is being treated at Bingham University Teaching Hospital in Jos, the state capital. “The circumstance that led to the infliction of the gun injury by the recalcitrant officer does not fit into his professional calling,” he said. “It was done out of vindictiveness which contradicts the attributes of a Nigerian police officer. “In order to ensure that the officer does not evade justice, he has been arrested, his firearm recovered and has since been detained for disciplinary action.” The police spokesperson condemned the action of the officer, describing it as “unprofessional”. Bartholomew Onyeka, commissioner of police in the state, is said to have ordered an investigation into the case. The police spokesperson said arrangements are being made to pay the medical bill of the victims. “As part of wholesome practice in the force, the erring officer has been defaulted and his orderly room trial will commence today, March 6,” he added. He said the outcome of the case will be disclosed to the public.
