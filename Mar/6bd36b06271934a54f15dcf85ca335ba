Chris Aburime, press secretary to Chukwuma Soludo, governor of Anambra, has dismissed an allegation of a plot to assassinate Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP). A message has gone viral on social media claiming that Soludo has been offered money to assassinate Obi. “Hold Soludo Responsible If Anything Happens To Peter Obi,” the title of the message reads. “Yesterday, a Helicopter entered Awka by 1:30 am and took Soludo to a secret meeting at Government House, Owerri. The agenda of the meeting is Peter Obi and how to stop him physically, politically, and otherwise,” the message reads. “Soludo was given five million dollars in 100 dollar bills for the hatchet job and Soludo promised to eliminate Peter Obi.” Reacting to the viral message on Monday, Aburime said the governor wasn’t offered any money to harm anyone, saying that Soludo wishes Peter Obi well. “I want to state categorically that there is no iota of truth in that write up, he did not go to Owerri and he was not offered any sum of money to harm anyone, not even his brother Mr Peter Obi an illustrious son of Anambra,” NAN quoted Aburime as saying. “Soludo wishes Obi well, he appreciates Anambra voters for supporting him massively, of course, he predicted his victory in Anambra, and remember, there was no form of violence or electoral malfeasance in Anambra, that speaks a lot about the peaceful nature of Soludo.” He said the development, protection of lives and property, and sustainable progress of Anambra should be the bigger picture occupying the minds of supporters than their personal interests. In November, Soludo penned an article where he forecasted that Obi “can’t and won’t win” the 2023 presidential election. The LP candidate came third behind Bola Tinubu, the president-elect and Atiku Abubakar, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the election that was conducted on February 25.
