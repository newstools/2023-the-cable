G-10 Parliamentary Advocacy Group (G-10 PAP), a legislative interest group, has tasked newly elected federal legislators to ensure critical scrutiny of requests from the executive arm. In a communique by Sunny Osiebe, G-10 national coordinator, Fred Itua and Nkem Anyata-Lafia, national secretary and national publicity secretary respectively, the group said the incoming national assembly should ensure that the selection of its leaders is guided by competence and federal character. It lamented the incessant interference of the executive arm in the activities of the legislature. “That the two chambers of the national assembly must be allowed a space that is completely devoid of any interference by the Executive to elect the next president of the senate, his deputy, speaker of the house of representatives and his deputy,” the statement reads. “That the next leaders of the 10th National Assembly must be individuals who understand the complexities of Nigeria and are willing to help in healing the anger and wounds brought about by our fault lines. “That such next leaders must not be rubber stamps in the hands of anyone. This is, however, not advocating for an antagonist National Assembly, but the fact remains that Nigerians deserve a National Assembly that will stand on the side of the people whenever the need arises. “That the selection of the next leaders of the National Assembly must reflect the Federal Character principle and the nation’s diversity. Every part of Nigeria must be carried along in the truest demonstration of our national diversity. “That the next leaders of the National Assembly must be willing to subject requests from the Executive to critical scrutiny, reviews, and collective decision. This is to avoid a situation where decisions, like the constant quests for loans, which have since become a daily routine of the present Administration and which have a direct impact on the nation at large, are left for a few lawmakers to decide.”
