David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi state, says he prayed for the victory of President-elect Bola Tinubu. Umahi spoke on Tuesday in Abakaliki, the state capital, while addressing stakeholders and the people of the Izzi clan. The governor said he did not hide his supplications to God that Tinubu and all the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates should win at the polls. “I prayed to God to bring Tinubu on board, give me a voice to stand with the people and bring unity to Nigeria,” he said. “I promised God that I will fight a battle to reunite this country and bring peace and prosperity to it. “This is my pledge to God and I will do it because it is time for the leaders of this country to make sacrifices. “The situation is bad, the country’s resources can develop it, with Ebonyi being an example.” He called on Igbo people to support the government in power in their various states for them to have peace. “It is where a man lives that he prospers as you can’t be staying in a place and plot against its people,” he said. Umahi urged the Izzi people to be united to win the gubernatorial poll. “I cannot support anybody from the southern senatorial district as myself to succeed me,” he said. “Anybody from Izzi supporting someone from the south to become governor is not normal but you should not fight such a person. “Such a person has already destroyed him or herself because this is payback time for you for supporting the south in 2015.” Umahi is the senator-elect for Ebonyi south senatorial district.
