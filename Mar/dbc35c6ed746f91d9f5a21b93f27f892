The Kano government has alleged that there are plans by the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) to disrupt the governorship and state assembly elections. In a statement issued on Monday, Muhammad Garba, commissioner for information, said the government was compelled to bring the plan to the attention of the public “because this could disrupt the governorship and house of assembly elections to its favour”. Garba said the government received credible information on how thugs will be hired from villages in Kano and beyond to disrupt the electoral process through violence, massive rigging, box snatching, and arson. He alleged that the NNPP is planning to cause mayhem, disperse voters at polling units and subvert the will of the people. Garba assured that the state government would resist any attempt by the opposition to rig the March 11 elections. The commissioner called on security agencies to be alive to their responsibility by fishing out any individual or group bent on fomenting trouble and preventing the people from exercising their rights. The police command in the state had earlier warned political parties, their candidates, and supporters against any acts of violence and thuggery. Abdullahi Kiyawa, spokesperson of the command, also assured of their neutrality during the elections.
