The Goodluck Jonathan Foundation (GJF) says more investment in technology will address structural biases against women and girls in Nigeria. Wealth Ominabo, communication officer of the foundation, issued a statement on Wednesday to commemorate the 2023 International Women’s Day. International Women’s Day is celebrated across the world on March 8 every year. The foundation said the government should prioritise implementing policies that will eliminate discrimination against women and also build an inclusive society. “The Goodluck Jonathan Foundation celebrates with Nigerian women and others across the world on this year’s International Women’s Day. We acknowledge and appreciate the strides and notable contributions of women toward sustainable development and nation-building,” the statement reads. “This year’s theme ‘DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality’, highlights the need for increased investment in technology for girls and women in our society as well the urgent task to ensure that violence against women both online and offline are addressed. “On International Day 2023, we renew our call for an inclusive society, one that is just, equitable, devoid of bias and discrimination. “Let us embrace equity in all spheres of our society, by initiating policies and programmes that will address structural biases against women and girls. This way, we can build an equitable and peaceful society.”
