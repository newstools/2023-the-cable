The police command in Ogun says it has arrested five suspected members of a gang that specialises in exhuming corpses and removing their body parts for rituals. In a statement on Sunday, Abimbola Oyeyemi, the state police spokesperson, said the suspects were arrested after intelligence received by the police at Odogbolu divisional headquarters. He said Godwin Idehai, the divisional police officer (DPO) of Odogbolu division, immediately mobilised officers and stormed the suspects’ hideout where five were apprehended. Oyeyemi said the names of the members of the gang are Oshole Fayemi, 60; Oseni Adesanya, 39; Ismaila Seidu, 30; Oseni Oluwasegun, 69 and Lawal Olaiya, 50. “On interrogation, the suspects made confessional statements that they were actually into the business of exhuming corpses from their graves,” Oyeyemi said. “They said that they usually sold the exhumed body parts to their clients who used them for money-making rituals.” Meanwhile, Frank Mba, the commissioner of police in the state, has directed that the suspects be transferred to the state criminal investigation department (SCIID) for discreet investigation and possible prosecution. The state has been in the news for strange incidents happening in its environs. On February 10, the police announced the arrest of three suspects in connection with the murder of a couple — Kehinde and Bukola Fatinoye — and their son.
