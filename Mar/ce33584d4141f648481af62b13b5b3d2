Dr. Steve Maraboli touts, As I look back on my life, I realize that every time I thought I was being rejected from something good, I was actually being redirected to something better. Infertility has significant adverse social impacts on the lives of infertile couples, especially women, who frequently experience violence, divorce, social stigma, emotional stress, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Technology, on the other hand, advances by the day, and our lives have continued to enjoy the incremental change in drastic ways. But what about fertility? How are technological advancements affecting our abilities to reproduce? In this article, we look at how fertility changes as technology advances and what implications this has for us. We will explore the potential effects of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and artificial intelligence (AI) and discuss some of the ethical questions arising in light of these developments. Follow through to learn more about the exciting possibilities that technology holds for the future of fertility. Noteworthy that Fertility treatments have changed a lot in recent years thanks to technological advances. Here is a look at the current state of fertility treatments and how they are helping people conceive. In-vitro fertilization (IVF): IVF, a complex series of procedures used to help with fertility or prevent genetic problems and assist with the conception of a child, is among the most common and effective fertility treatments available today. It involves retrieving eggs from the ovary, fertilizing them with sperm in a lab, and then transferring the embryos to the uterus. One cycle of IVF takes about two months. Available data reveals that women younger than 35 will get pregnant and have a baby with their first IVF egg retrieval and subsequent embryo transfer(s) about half the time. Intended Parents can determine gender through preimplantation genetic diagnosis, screening, or testing for aneuploidy (PGD/PGS/PGT-A) during an IVF journey. With more AI infusion and learning, these probabilities will continue to increase, just as some research has shown that AI plays a promising role in the decision-making process to support the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and much more. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): ICSI, an effective treatment for men with infertility, is a variation of IVF used when there are issues with sperm quality or quantity. With ICSI, a single sperm is injected into each egg. ICSI can be used even if infertility is unrelated to a problem with sperm. Some couples try ICSI after repeated in vitro fertilization has not worked. Records show that the success rate for ICSI can range from 85% to 90%, depending on expertise. It means that 8 to 9 eggs out of 10 eggs get fertilized normally after ICSI. One cycle of ICSI takes between four weeks and six weeks to complete. The couple can expect to spend a half-day at the clinic for the egg and sperm retrieval procedures and return between two and five days later for the embryo transfer procedure. Technological research is looking carefully into the details of what works and a possible reason for the ease of reproducibility. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): PGD is a type of genetic testing that can be done on embryos before they are transferred to the uterus. It can be used to screen for certain genetic disorders or defects. The most common single-gene disorders that PGD has been used for are Cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Hemophilia, and Sickle cell disease, among others. It can be offered when one or both genetic parents have or are carriers of a known genetic abnormality. Assisted hatching: This is a procedure sometimes done with IVF. It involves making a small hole in the outer layer of an embryo so that it can easily hatch and implant itself into the lining of the uterus. It is believed that assisted hatching can help an embryo implant in the uterus, leading to higher pregnancy rates in some patients. Imagine what becomes possible when all the data from various fertility processes are analyzed to spot trends and related patterns. Embryo cryopreservation: Embryo cryopreservation is a way to preserve embryos for future use. It is often used alongside IVF to improve the chances of success. The embryos are frozen and can be thawed and placed in a woman’s uterus. Embryo cryopreservation is a type of fertility preservation. Frozen embryos are stored and monitored at hospital facilities, usually a lab, or commercial reproductive medicine centers, and can be safely preserved for 10 years and even longer. Regarding fertility treatments, technology has come a long way in recent years. From at-home ovulation kits to in-vitro fertilization (IVF), there are now more options than ever for couples struggling to conceive. One of the biggest changes technology has brought to fertility treatments is increased accessibility. In the past, many couples had to travel to specialized clinics to receive treatment, but now more and more fertility clinics are popping up nationwide. This means couples can receive the care they need without having to incur the extra costs associated with travel. In addition, technology has also made fertility treatments more affordable. Thanks to new advancements, such as freezing eggs and embryos, couples no longer have to pay for multiple cycles of IVF to increase their chances of success. This not only saves them money but it also reduces the physical and emotional toll that fertility treatments can take on a person. Finally, technology has also made fertility treatments more successful. Thanks to advances in medical science, we now understand how conception works and what factors can impact it. This has led to the development of new and improved treatment methods that are helping more and more couples achieve their dream of starting a family. How about having a formula for conception and then training the same with some big data? The future of fertility treatments is shrouded in potential but fraught with uncertainty. On the one hand, rapid advances in technology are leading to new and more effective fertility treatments, while on the other hand, the high costs of these treatments and their side effects continue to be a major barrier for many couples. However, IVF is expensive, with a single cycle often costing upwards of $10,000. Additionally, IVF can cause side effects such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can be painful and dangerous. As technology advances, several potential new fertility treatments show promise. One such treatment is in-vitro maturation (IVM), which involves retrieving immature eggs from a woman’s ovaries and maturing them in a lab dish before fertilizing them with sperm. IVM has been shown to be just as effective as traditional IVF but with a much lower risk of OHSS. Additionally, because IVM does not require powerful drugs to stimulate egg production, it is much less expensive than traditional IVF, with a single cycle typically costing around $5,000. Another promising new fertility treatment is intrauterine insemination (IUI), which involves placing sperm directly into the uterus. it takes approximately two weeks after the procedure to determine if the treatment is successful after a positive pregnancy test. As technology advances, so does our understanding of fertility. We now know that there are many factors that can affect a couple’s ability to conceive, and we have more tools than ever before to help couples overcome infertility. However, this doesn’t mean that conceiving is always easy. There are still many couples who struggle to conceive, and the advances in technology can sometimes be overwhelming. But there is hope. Couples who are struggling to conceive can talk to their doctor about their options and find the fertility treatment that is right for them. With the help of modern medicine, many couples are able to have the baby they’ve always wanted. In conclusion, as technology advances, so does the understanding of fertility. From at-home tests and in-depth genetic analysis to IVF treatments, new technologies are being developed that can help us understand our reproductive health in ways never before possible. It is important for couples to stay informed about the latest advancements in fertility care, as well as to consult with their doctor if they have any questions or concerns regarding their own fertility journey. With a better understanding of how your body works, you can make better decisions when it comes to planning for pregnancy and having a healthy family. Thank you for the investment in time.
