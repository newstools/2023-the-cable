Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, has described the victory of Bola Tinubu, the president-elect, as a much-deserved triumph that reflected the will of the Nigerian masses. In the early hours of Wednesday, Mahmood Yakubu, chairperson of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), declared Tinubu as the president-elect after he secured a total of 8,794,726 votes in the presidential election. Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had the second-highest figure with 6,984,520 votes, while Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) was next with 6,101,533 votes. In a congratulatory statement signed by him, El-Rufai expressed confidence that Tinubu would lead Nigeria forward with renewed hope. The Kaduna governor said the success at the polls came amidst the most onerous circumstances for the candidates of a ruling party. “APC has a duty to repay this faith by providing purposeful governance that delivers progressive outcomes for all Nigerians,” the statement reads. ’I have no doubt that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu grasps the import of this victory and will lead Nigeria’s forward march with renewed hope. He knows he has our staunch support in bringing Nigerians together and uniting the country in common endeavours for progress, peace, and prosperity.’’
