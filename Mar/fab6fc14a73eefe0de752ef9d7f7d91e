Four persons have been reportedly injured after suspected thugs attacked the convoy of Jonathan Asake, the governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP), in Kaduna state. In a statement on Friday, James Swan, media aide to Asake, said the convoy of the LP candidate was attacked at Gidan Waya in Jema’a LGA of the state. “The Labour Party governorship campaign convoy of Hon. Jonathan Asake in Kaduna state was attacked by thugs today in Gidan Waya, Jema’a local government area,” the statement reads. “Four youths were injured in the process, including two boys and two girls. No vehicle was damaged. “The incident happened when the campaign convoy was passing through Gidan Waya during Friday prayers on its way to Godogodo and other towns as the campaign team toured the Local Government. “After the first three vehicles in the convoy made their way through the old tyres used to demarcate the road, thugs started throwing stones, big sticks and other harmful objects at the long convoy. “It took the timely intervention of the security personnel attached to the candidate to forestall a crisis.”
