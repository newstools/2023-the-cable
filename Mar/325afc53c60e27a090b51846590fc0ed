OXFAM Nigeria, a non-profit organisation, says issues around gender equality are gaining more attention across the world. Vincent Anonsi, OXFAM country director in Nigeria, said this in a statement on Wednesday to mark the 2023 International Women’s Day. Anonsi said the organisation has contributed to increasing gender inclusion in production and politics through capacity-building initiatives. “While the focus on gender equality is gaining traction globally, Oxtfam Nigeria reaffirms its dedication to attaining a gender-just society, where opportunities, resources, and decision-making are not influenced by gender orientation,” he said. “Our interventions have achieved an increased participation of women in the productive space and positively change power relations in both the private and public sectors of the society, through the adoption of gender transformative approaches, and the integration of feminism into our programming. “Our achievements include the deepening of women’s financial inclusion and socio-economic enfranchisement through the Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA), Increased political inclusion through training and sensitization on Transformative Leadership for Women’s Rights (TLWRs), the integration of gender transformative approaches such as Gender Action Leaning Systems (GALS), and Rapid Centre Analysis (RCA). “We facilitate socio-economic reintegration of survivors of Gender Based Violence (GBV), and also integrate women and girls from underserved communities into the society through capacity building, and enhanced inclusion in the digital space.” The country director called for more support in improving gender equality and creating an inclusive society.
