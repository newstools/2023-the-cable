The Department of State Services (DSS) on Monday announced it has created social media accounts to enhance public and stakeholder engagement in its operations. Peter Afunanya, DSS spokesperson, listed the handles as @OfficialDSSNG (Twitter); OfficialDSSNG (Facebook); and @OfficialDSSNG (Instagram). Hours after the Twitter handle sent its first tweet, Nigerians on the microblogging platform have been engaging with the tweet. While most welcomed the development, saying it will restore sanity on the platform and also reduce the spread of fake news, some questioned the timing and wondered if the freedom of citizens won’t be trampled upon on social media. “Very good development. I hope this won’t be a step to censoring journalists and law-abiding citizens,” Mustapha Usman, a journalist tweeted. “All of you that spread fake news should sha be careful before they pick you up,” Successful Erica, another user tweeted. Below are reactions. All of you that spread fake news should sha be careful before they pick you up https://t.co/7M7ett3i6I — SuccessfulErica (@Ericaisblessed4) March 6, 2023  Very good development.
