The Lagos police command says it will prosecute peddlers of fake news and “provocative content” on social media with the intent to cause panic in the state. There has been an increase in the level of propaganda and inciting ethnic statements among social media users in relation to the March 11 gubernatorial election in the state. Reacting to this development on Monday, Benjamin Hundeyin, the spokesperson of the command, said the police in the state have commenced an investigation into related cases with the aim of prosecuting those found guilty. “The command has begun investigating this scaremongering with a view to apprehending and prosecuting those found culpable.,” Hundeyin said. “The good people and residents of the state are urged to disregard all forms of messages, especially on social media depicting fictitious, fallacious, and preposterous claims aimed at jeopardizing the peace currently being enjoyed in the state.” He said Idowu Owohunwa, the Lagos commissioner of police, has assured the electorate of free, fair and credible elections. “Voters are encouraged to come out to exercise their franchise and not succumb to the panic tactics of a few unpatriotic elements masquerading as concerned and well-intentioned Nigerians on social media,” he said. “It is equally imperative to warn against mischief around the polling units and collation centres and beyond, as anyone found culpable will be promptly arrested and dealt with in accordance with the law.”
