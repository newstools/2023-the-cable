The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says it will construct overhead bridges at 11 level crossings in Lagos. Fidet Okhiria, managing director of NRC, in an interview with NAN on Tuesday, said the agency has commenced the separation of road from rail in the Oyingbo and Ebute-Metta areas of Lagos. The development comes a few days after a Lagos staff bus was crushed by a moving train when it veered into a rail track. The train-bus accident affected 102 persons, with six deaths recorded. Speaking in relation to the incident, Okhiria said the NRC will employ personnel to stop vehicles from passing level crossings during train movement. He said the corporation will also incorporate the use of technology to alert road users whenever trains approach level crossings. “We are going to have 11 flyovers within Lagos and we cannot do all at the same time. We are constructing them in batches,” Okhiria said. “Before now, we constructed barriers and they were vandalised. We even constructed automatic barriers which were also vandalised. “Although we have been repairing them, especially the automatic barriers, they do not last for a week after such repairs. “It is either they hit the barriers with vehicles or people vandalise them overnight.”
