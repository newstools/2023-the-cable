Okezie Ikpeazu, governor of Abia state, says he is a fulfilled man despite losing his bid to secure a senate seat. Ikpeazu contested for the Abia south district senatorial seat but was defeated by Enyinnaya Abaribe, the incumbent. Abaribe, who was formerly in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), ran on the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). Abaribe polled 49,693 votes while Chinedu Onyeizu of the Labour Party (LP) polled 43,903 votes to come second, and Ikpeazu secured 28,422 votes to come third. The senator defected to APGA after Ikpeazu clinched the PDP ticket for the senatorial election. The governor is a member of the G5 group that was against the presidential bid of Atiku Abubakar of the PDP. Two other members of the G5 also failed in their senatorial ambitions. In a statement signed by Onyebuchi Ememanka, his chief press secretary, Ikpeazu said his government is committed to ensuring peace and security in Abia. “Our government is resolutely committed to ensuring continuous security and peace that Abia has consistently enjoyed under my watch,” he said. “We are grateful to God that so far there is no single account of any loss of life during the presidential and national assembly elections. There were also no reports of electoral violence. “On a personal note, I am a fulfilled man. I have won many battles and elections, including defeating Covid-19. Elections will come and go every four years and just like in any other contest, you win some and lose some.” Ikpeazu added that the state government is resolute in ensuring that the peace and security which defined the last elections would be replicated in the gubernatorial and state house of assembly polls.
