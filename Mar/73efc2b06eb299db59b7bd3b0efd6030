Frank Geng-Quangrong, a Chinese national remanded over the “murder” of Ummukulsum Buhari, a Kano resident, says he did not intend to kill her. During a cross-examination at the court session on Thursday, the defendant said “I did not intend to kill Ummukulsum and I don’t want to be killed”. “She injured me on my genitals and I cannot show the court it is against our Chinese culture and I am a Muslim,” he added. Led in evidence by his lawyer, Muhammad Dan’azumi, the defendant also tendered exhibits including a black Redmi mobile phone, WhatsApp messages, pictures, videos of the deceased, and a certificate of compliance dated March 8. “The exhibits include the defendant’s phone, and WhatsApp computer-generated chats between Frank and Ummukulsum between September 13 and September 16, 2022,” Dan’azumi said. “Other exhibits include pictures, the receipt of the N5 million gold jewelry he bought for Ummukulsum, and a 4GB black flash drive containing videos of the deceased in his house.” NAN reports that the video played in court showed the deceased playing with a pet dog named Charlie in Frank’s house in Railway Quarters, Kano. Dan’azumi played the second video clip to the court showing the deceased on site of her house in Abuja, as well as a picture of her sitting on seven bails of clothes the accused bought for their marriage. Geng-Quangrong, 47, was arrested by the police in September 2022 for stabbing the 22-year-old to death at her residence in Janbulo quarters, Kumbotso LGA of Kano. He is standing trial on charges bordering on culpable homicide.
