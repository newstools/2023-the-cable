The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) says it has arrested members of two syndicate groups allegedly involved in the production and distribution of counterfeit United States dollars (USD) and new naira notes. During an interview with the NAN in Abuja on Friday, Olusola Odumosu, NSCDC’s public relations director, said the suspects were arrested in Plateau state between February 22 and March 8. Odumosu said members of one of the groups, consisting of four men, were arrested in possession of fake 64,800 dollars and N475,000. He also said the counterfeit notes of N1.5 million were seized from the second group of five men. “From the seized N1.5 million, N784,500 were counterfeit new naira notes while N49,650 was old naira notes,”  he said. He said members of the first group were apprehended following an intelligence report that they were on their way to deliver the fake notes to a client in Nasarawa state. Odumosu added that the suspects have made confessions about their involvement, noting that the corps was carrying out extensive investigations and manhunting other fleeing syndicate members. He said investigations revealed that the syndicates had operated in Plateau, Nasarawa, Bauchi, and Gombe states for years before their apprehension.
