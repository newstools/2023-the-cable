Seriake Dickson, a former governor of Bayelsa state, has been elected for a second term in the senate. Dickson represents Bayelsa west in the upper legislative chamber of the national assembly. The former Bayelsa governor scored 27,231 votes to defeat Ayakpo Danyegha, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Samuel Enahoro, the returning officer for Bayelsa west, declared Dickson of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the winner of the senatorial election. The development means that Dickson, who was governor between 2012 and 2020, will be representing his district for the second time. The PDP also won the two other senatorial districts â€” Bayelsa central and Bayelsa east. Benson Agadaga and Benson Kombowei were declared winners of the Bayelsa east and Bayelsa central senatorial districts respectively by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
