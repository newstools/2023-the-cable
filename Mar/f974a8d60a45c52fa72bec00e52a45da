Family & Youth Support Initiative (FYSI), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), has advised female police officers not to see the digital aspects of their job as exclusive to their male colleagues. At an event organised by the NGO to mark the 2023 International Women’s Day (IWD), the police officers were introduced to how they can use digital technology to accelerate their career growth and maximise their potential. Bukoladeremi Ladigbolu, executive director of FYSI, who delivered a lecture on the theme of the IWD at the Idimu police division, challenged them to learn new skills. She said as mothers, female officers must encourage their daughters to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Ladigbolu urged them not to feel inferior to their male counterparts, but to be involved in all aspects of their official duties, especially in intelligence and forensics, which often require the use of science and technology. She implored them to use technology for self-development and to create additional streams of income without violating the codes of their profession. “Between husband and wife, I am aware that the bible expects us to treat our husbands as the head. I want to assume that the Quran also prescribes the same,” she said. “But when it comes to professional relationships, women must not allow themselves to be relegated to the background. We must be ready to learn the skills and embrace challenges that will help us get to the top in our chosen career.”
