The All Progressives Congress (APC) says it respects the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to postpone the governorship and state house of assembly elections by one week. The polls, initially billed to be held on March 11, have been shifted to March 18. INEC said the “necessary” decision would enable it to reconfigure the bimodal voter accreditation system (BVAS). The electoral body said the period would also enable it to backup data from the presidential election that was held on February 25. In a statement on Thursday, Felix Morka, spokesperson of the APC, said the commission should use the period to identify gaps in the electoral process to make it hitch-free. “We enjoin INEC to use the opportunity presented by the election postponement to address any gaps or hitches identified in the presidential election in order to avoid a recurrence in the March 18, election,” Morka said. “Even as presidential candidates and their political parties explore and exercise their constitutional liberty to challenge or defend the outcome of the presidential and national assembly elections, we must remind ourselves of the overriding duty that we bear to eschew conduct and action capable of undermining the peace of our country or imperil the capacity of INEC to conduct the upcoming gubernatorial and state assembly elections. “Our candidate, now president-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, emerged as the overwhelming choice of Nigerians in the presidential election which was free, fair and in substantial compliance with the electoral act and INEC guidelines for the 2023 general elections. “We are thankful for our renewed presidential mandate, and urge our supporters and indeed all Nigerians to double down on their support for our great party, and its candidates in the upcoming gubernatorial and state assembly election.”
