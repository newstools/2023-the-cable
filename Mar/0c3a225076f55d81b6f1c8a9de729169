He is yet to make his intention public but TheCable understands that the lawmaker is still consulting and will soon make an official announcement. Idris Wase, deputy speaker; Ben Kalu, chairman of the committee on media; and Muktar Betara, chairman of the committee on appropriation, are among those said to be considering contesting for the speakership position. In a statement issued on Monday, Danladi Ahmed, president of the group, said as a youth, the 42-year-old legislator has the experience to be the speaker. “As the party prepares to work out the zoning arrangements for the next 10th National Assembly, we would like to make case for Rt. Honourable Yusuf Gagdi, the member representing Pankshin/Kanam/Kanke Federal Constituency of Plateau State to emerge the next Speaker of the House of Representatives,” the statement reads. “We also urged the party leadership to zone the Speakership position to the North Central geopolitical zone in the interest of justice, fairness and inclusive participation in governance. “Gagdi, who currently chairs the House Committee on Navy, is a vibrant and versatile lawmaker who has all the requisite legislative experience and leadership acumen to pilot the affairs of the 10th House of Representatives. “Gagdi has garnered robust legislative experience to pilot the affairs of the 10th House of Representatives.” The group asked lawmakers to “rally around Gagdi” and elect him as speaker of the 10th national assembly. The lawmaker was first elected to the house of representatives in 2019. Gagdi has sponsored several bills which have been passed into law, including Police Act 2020, and National Hydrographic Agency Act 2021.
