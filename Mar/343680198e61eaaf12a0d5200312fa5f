The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna state has urged residents to vote out the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the upcoming governorship and state assembly elections. The elections are scheduled to hold across the country on March 11. In a statement on Sunday by Reuben Buhari, deputy director, media and publicity, PDP state campaign directorate, the party urged the people not to be discouraged by the outcome of the presidential and national assembly elections, but to vote out “impunity” in the governorship election. The opposition party secured the highest votes to defeat the APC in Kaduna during the February 25 polls. It won the three senatorial seats and 10 out of the 16 house of representatives seats. “If our dream is to have a secure, prosperous Kaduna state, then we owe it a duty to ourselves and our families to come out and vote for the PDP on Saturday,” the statement reads. “Not voting would ensure that more of our people in Kaduna state get sacked with impunity, or forcefully retired without getting their benefits. Not voting might ensure the continuation of school fees increment in Kaduna’s tertiary institutions without regard to the common man. “Abstaining from voting would continue to see our traditional institutions bastardised without recourse to what the people genuinely desire. We will continue to witness more demolitions of houses and shops that the common man is using for sustenance; we will continue to see the forceful seizure of people’s land. “With us all strategically closing ranks, we will emerge with enough votes to ensure that the APC never again brings any hardship to the residents of Kaduna state. They might employ and deploy all manner of illegalities to woo voters before and during the elections.”
