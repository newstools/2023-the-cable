The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) says troops operating in the north have foiled attacks targeted at disrupting the 2023 general election. Musa Danmadami, director, defence media operations, said the attacks were orchestrated by terrorists. Speaking on Thursday at the bi-weekly briefing, he said on the eve of the February 25 polls, troops were alerted about some terrorists converging at Kauwa, Gamboru and Monguno in Borno state. Danmadami said upon the receipt of the intelligence, the air component of the operation struck the identified locations, killed many of the terrorists and destroyed their logistics. “The air component of Operation Hadin Kai conducted several air interdiction operations against terrorist enclaves and logistics in support of ground operations,” Danmadami said. “Notably, on 24 February 2023, an intelligence report revealed terrorist convergence with plans to attack some locations in Kauwa, Gamboru and Monguno in Borno State in a bid to disrupt the 2023 general elections. “Consequently, series of air interdiction operations were carried out at these identified locations. Feedback revealed that the airstrike dealt with terrorists, as several terrorist were neutralized with their logistics destroyed.” Danmadami added that troops also arrested eight political thugs on election day while on patrol in Okehi, Okenne LGA of Kogi state. The defence media director said the arrested thugs are suspected to be attempting to disrupt the electoral process in the area. Danmadami said the troops recovered three pump action guns, two locally fabricated AK 47 rifles, six locally made assorted guns and two daggers from the political thugs.
