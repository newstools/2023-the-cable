Bayern Munich scored two-second half goals to defeat Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) 2-0 in the second leg of their UEFA Champions League (UCL) round-of-16 tie at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. Goals from Eric Choupo-Moting and Serge Gnabry ensured the Bavarians consolidated their 1-0 first leg win while silencing both Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi in a 3-0 aggregate victory. A first half that failed to deliver gave way for a second period in which Bayern saw a goal disallowed for offside on Thomas Muller before Choupo-Moting finished off from close range to give the host the lead on 61 minutes. Julian Naggelsmann’s side sealed victory on the night when Gnabry clipped home Joao Cancelo’s cross on 89 minutes. The win is Bayern’s third consecutive  against a PSG side that has exited the UCL at the last 16 stage in three consecutive seasons, equalling a similar fate suffered between 2017 and 2019. Bayern are however in the UCL quarter finals for a fourth consecutive season. Elsewhere, AC Milan held on to nick a second leg 0-0 draw against Tottenham to qualify for the quarter final with a 1-0 aggregate victory. The Serie A side are into the quarter final stage for the fist time in 11 years.
