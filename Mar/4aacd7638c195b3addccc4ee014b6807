President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the death of Franca Afegbua, Nigeria’s first female senator, who died at the age of 79. NAN reports that Buhari sent his condolence after his return to Abuja from Daura, his hometown in Katsina, on Monday. TheCable reported that Afegbua, a native of Okpella in Edo state, died on Sunday morning. Buhari said her exploration into politics changed the political narrative for women in the legislature during the second republic. He said winning the senatorial seat under the National Party of Nigeria paved way for women’s participation in Nigeria’s politics.

Buhari condoled with her family, friends, and associates adding that her “adventure into political leadership lifted the glass ceiling for women in the legislature in the second republic”. The president also commiserated with the Edo state government and the community ”where she had remained an inspiration to young women, lifting many out of hopelessness through mentorship, and creating opportunities for others to realize their dreams in various careers”. He urged her family to safeguard her good works for posterity and prayed that God receives the soul of the departed.
