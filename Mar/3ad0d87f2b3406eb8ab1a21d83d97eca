The Flying Eagles of Nigeria have booked their place in the U20 World Cup billed for Indonesia later in the year. The Nigerians qualified for the competition following a 1-0 victory over the Hippos of Uganda in the quarter-final of the ongoing U20 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) on Thursday. An own-goal from Uganda’s Ibrahim Juma was enough to send the Eagles into the semi-final of the African age-grade competition in Egypt. The Nigerians, who entered the round of eight after finishing second in Group A, endured early pressure from the Ugandans and were kept in the match by Chijioke Aniagboso, Eagles goalkeeper, and his brilliant anticipation and positioning. The Ladan Bosso-led boys favoured direct football and punting the ball up the pitch from their defence. The simple game plan bore fruit in the 30th minute. Abel Ogwuche sent a long ball forward from the defence and it found Ibrahim Muhammed, whose speed and guile were enough to afford him space in the Ugandan goal area. The 19-year-old smacked his shot against the upright, and the ball ricocheted off a stunned Juma into the net. The Eagles’ defence held on for victory despite attempts from the Hippos. Nigeria joins Senegal as the two countries to have qualified for the World Cup scheduled to hold from May 20 to June 11. The winners of the two remaining quarter-final clashes — Gambia/South Sudan and Congo/Tunisia — will join the two teams.
