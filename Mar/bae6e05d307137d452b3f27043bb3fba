Bola Tinubu, Nigeria’s president-elect, says mindless killings have no place in the country. The president-elect was reacting to an attack on a police station in Maru LGA of Zamfara. In the early hours of Sunday, gunmen attacked the station, killing Kazeem Raheem, its divisional police officer (DPO), and Rabi’u Umar, a police inspector. In a statement on Monday, Abdulaziz Abdulaziz, an aide of Tinubu, quoted him as saying that citizens have to be united to “defeat these killers”. “As a country, we have to come together to defeat these merchants of death and terror once and for all,” Tinubu said. “Mindless killings and atrocities like this should have no place in our country.” He said there should be an investigation into the murder of the district head of Maigari in Kano state, who was the father of Munir Dahiru Maigari, Rimin Gado LGA chairman. The president-elect condoled the families of Ahmad Gumi, an Islamic cleric, and the late Sani Abacha. While Gumi lost his mother, the Abacha family lost Abdullahi, a son. “It is touching to part with a loved one, no matter the circumstances and age,” he said. “We cannot question the will of Allah but we can only pray that Almighty Allah grants them eternal rest and give us the fortitude to bear their demise.”
