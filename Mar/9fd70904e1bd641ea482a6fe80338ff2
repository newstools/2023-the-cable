The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has arraigned Abdulsalam Abdulkarim, the Kano central senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), over allegations of fraud. The defendant, popularly known as Zaura, was arraigned on Wednesday before Mohammed Yunusa, judge of a federal high court in Kano. According to the EFCC, Zaura allegedly defrauded a Kuwaiti citizen of the sum of $1,320,000 under the pretext that he is in the business of building properties in Dubai, Kuwait and other Arab countries. He pleaded not guilty to the four-count charge bordering on obtaining money by false pretence. Following his plea, Aisha Habib, counsel for the prosecution, asked for a trial date. However, Ishaq Dikko, counsel representing the defendant, prayed the court to grant his client bail. After a brief argument between the parties, the judge ruled that the defendant continues with the bail terms earlier granted to him by the court. The matter has been adjourned till May 2, 2023 for the commencement of trial. This is the second time the defendant is being tried. He was previously arraigned on the same offences in 2018 but was discharged and acquitted in 2020 by Lewis Allagoa, judge. However, in April 2022, Â the court of appeal nullified his discharge and acquittal and ordered a retrial.
