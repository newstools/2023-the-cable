A federal high court has sentenced Garba Tahir, former accountant, pensions at the office of the head of service of the federation, to three years imprisonment for fraud. Tahir was the pension accountant when Stephen Oronsaye was the head of service (HoS) between 2009 and 2010. Oronsaye is also facing a N2 billion money laundering charge before the same court. The former accountant was arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a seven-count amended charge that bordered on money laundering. He was accused of diverting over N26 million through his Eco bank account using Charo Bureau De Change Ltd, among others. Delivering judgment on Friday, Inyang Ekwo, the presiding judge, held that the EFCC proved its case against Tahir. “In the case, it was clear that the allegations of money laundering were premised on the conversion of resources derived directly or indirectly from an illegal act,” Ekwo said. “In this case, the aim of the conversion is either to conceal or disguise the illicit origin of the resources or property. “In this case, I have to agree with the prosecution that the facts of conversion have been consistent in each and every count in being emphatic about the undisclosed origin of the transaction or payment. “This has given rise to the several cash lodgements into the private bank account of the defendant either in person or by using proxies thereby leading to the conclusion that there is intention to conceal the illicit origin of the cash in question. “This is what I found in this case. I find that the prosecution has proved the case against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.” The judge sentenced him to three years imprisonment on each of the counts. However, the judge held that the sentence would run concurrently. which means that the convict would only serve three years jail term instead of 21. The sentencing starts to run from April 3.
