Boko Haram terrorists have abducted “seven persons” during an attack in Ngamma village in Borno state. According to Zagazola Makama, a publication focused on the Lake Chad region, the attack was carried out by the terrorists on Thursday. The insurgents were said to have invaded the village in the evening and kidnapped three men and four women at gunpoint. A source who spoke with Zagazola Makama said the terrorists took the victims away through the Gudumbali axis. Gudumbali is the headquarters of Guzamala LGA in Borno where members of the Islamic States of West African Province (ISWAP) are active. The source said the insurgents are yet to contact the families of the victims to demand ransom for their release. The publication said a security source who confirmed the development noted that the Nigerian Army has intensified efforts in the fight against terrorists in the area. The source said the terrorists are now facing hardship and hunger, forcing them to succumb to kidnapping for ransom. More than 300 Boko Haram terrorists are believed to have surrendered to the troops of the Nigerian military in Mafa, Konduga and Bama within the past week.
