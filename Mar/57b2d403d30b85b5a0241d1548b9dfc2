Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, has fired Ford Ozumba, commissioner for labour and productivity. In a statement issued on Saturday by Declan Emelumba, the state commissioner for information and strategy, no reason was given for Ozumba’s removal from office. According to NAN, Ozumba was directed to handover to the permanent secretary of the ministry with immediate effect. The development is coming at a time workers in the state under the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) embarked on an industrial action. In a statement, Joe Ajaero, NLC president, had accused the state government of using armed thugs and personnel of the Nigeria Police Force to interfere with the election of new state executives of the union. The NLC president alleged that the Imo state government sought to influence the outcome of the elections in the state by offering gratifications to the delegates to vote for their chosen candidates. “This meddlesomeness was resisted by the delegates who refused the unholy offerings and baits to vote for their chosen candidates,” Ajaero said.
