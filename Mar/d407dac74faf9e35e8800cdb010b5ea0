Sunday Dare, the minister of sports and youth development, on Friday, commended the Flying Eagles for their third-place finish at the CAF U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cairo, Egypt. Nigeria defeated Tunisia 4-0 to clinch the bronze medal, finishing on the podium in the competition for a record 13 times. Dare, who described the “bronze medal as better than nothing,” charged the team to imbibe the lessons learnt at the tournament as they prepare for the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Indonesia in May. “We were disappointed we couldn’t play in the final or win this competition as we planned to but this convincing victory over Tunisia has redeemed the pain we felt last Monday after the Gambia game,” he said. “We have to now focus on doing a lot better at the FIFA U-20 World Cup. There is very little time left but I believe the coaches now know where their focus should be in improving the team.” Senegal will take on The Gambia in the final of the U20 AFCON on Saturday.
