The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) says it will honour President Muhammadu Buhari with an award in recognition of his achievements in the defence and promotion of democracy in the subregion. Garba Shehu, the president’s spokesperson, said in a statement on Tuesday, that Umaro Sissoco Embalo, the ECOWAS chairman, announced the decision at a bilateral meeting with Buhari on the sidelines of the ongoing 5th United Nations conference on least developed countries (LDCs) in Qatar. Buhari is expected to be back in the country on Wednesday, March 8. Shehu quoted Embalo as saying that Nigeria’s leader had done more than any other to support democratic governments in West Africa just as he had done exceptionally well in waging battles against the emergence of non-democratic regimes. The ECOWAS chairman said Buhari would have his name on the “Roll of Honour” in the community’s new headquarters building upon its completion in Abuja. This, he said, would enable future generations of West African citizens to know about the greatness Buhari achieved and to emulate his laudable examples. Buhari welcomed the proposition, saying that democracy remained the best pathway to bringing together diverse people and a dependable vehicle for the achievement of national development.
