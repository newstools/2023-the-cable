Sunday Onuoha, a bishop of the Methodist Church Nigeria, says he is on a mission to restore the lost glory of Abia state. Onuoha is the governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in the south-east state. Speaking on Friday when he visited the traditional ruler of Ogbor Ancient Kingdom, the cleric said he is worried by the “widespread poverty” in the state. He said the state of infrastructure and dilapidation of the major markets in Aba were unacceptable to him. “People ask me why I joined the governorship race being a clergyman,” Onuoha said. “Of course, it is because of the appalling state of Abia that I joined the governorship contest. Our people are going through horrible times. “People are suffering and there is abject poverty everywhere. Salaries and pensions are not paid and people are living in serious despair. “It is now a thing of shame to publicly admit that one is from Abia, especially when you travel to other states of the federation.” The cleric promised to address the issues of poverty, infrastructure deficit and underdevelopment if elected. Onuoha said workers and retirees would receive their salaries and pensions when due. The cleric will be going up against Emenike Ikechi of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alex Otti of the Labour Party (LP), Ikonne Uchenna of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Ibe Charles of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the March 11 governorship election.
