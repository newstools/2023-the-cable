Racism is a bad disease and it can actually make someone commit suicide" – Best Foreign Athlete in Italy, Victor Osimhen pic.twitter.com/pzwTe96a9x —  @𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗷𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗯𝗼𝘆 (@OneJoblessBoy) March 6, 2023  “Since I came to Napoli, I have not experienced such in the city because everyone — black or white — takes each other like brothers and sisters,” he said. “Unlike the other cities. I’ve been racially abused twice, and it’s a bad feeling. But of course, the love from Napoli fans through messages, phone calls and even in the stadium makes me not really think about these things. Racism is a bad disease and it can actually make someone commit suicide.” The 24-year-old Nigerian has been a victim of discriminatory remarks since he moved to Italy in 2020. One incident was at the Stadio Bentegodi stadium in 2021 where Hellas Verona fans hurled monkey chants at him each time he touched the ball. Osimhen went on to score in the match and mocked the opposition fans for their action. He also suffered racism chants from fans of Roma and Florentina in 2020. Osimhen has been in blistering form for Napoli this season, leading the league goalscoring chart with 19 goals.
