The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says its website experienced glitches due to a “high number” of applications for its recruitment exercise. On Friday, the NDLEA announced a recruitment exercise for qualified Nigerians. The application, meant for secondary school leavers and graduates of polytechnics and universities, is expected to run from March 12 to April 8. However, reports of applicants facing difficulty accessing the website have surfaced. Checks by TheCable also showed that the agency’s website indicated server errors. Reacting to the situation, Femi Babafemi, NDLEA spokesperson, told The Cable that the glitches resulted from traffic on the website. The NDLEA spokesperson added that the issue would be resolved soon. “The recruitment portal has been experiencing some glitches because of the high volume of traffic,” Babafemi said. “Just in a moment we have over 2000 applicants trying to access the recruitment portal but our technical team is on it.” Candidates interested in the agency’s recruitment are required to visit the NDLEA webpage at www.ndlea.gov.ng and click on careers to begin the process.
