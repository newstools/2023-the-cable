The National Population Commission (NPC) says it is committed to conducting an inclusive census. On Monday, the federal government announced that it needed over $1.88 billion (N869 billion) to conduct the 2023 national census. The population and housing census will hold between March 29 and April 2, 2023. It will be the first in 17 years since the last census in 2006. Speaking during the inauguration of an 18-member census publicity committee in Gombe on Wednesday, Nasir Isa-Kwarra, NPC executive chairman, said the census would be accurate, reliable, and acceptable. Isa-Kwarra said the commission would deploy full digital technology to generate inclusive and user-friendly data for developmental planning purposes. The NPC chairman who was represented by Abubakar Danburam, the federal commissioner in the state, said the commission was carrying out quality preparations to have a census that meets international best standards. “I wish to use this opportunity to reassure my fellow countrymen and women and the international community that NPC is irrevocably committed to ensuring that everything about the 2023 census is done rightly and professionally,” he said. “We have the clear vision, commitment, and capacity to deliver on this historic mandate.” He encouraged members of the newly-inaugurated publicity committee to enlighten the public on the processes for the conduct of the census. Jude Maigari, NPC director in the state, appealed to relevant stakeholders in the state to support the committee and the commission’s efforts toward conducting an exercise that is professional and error-free.
