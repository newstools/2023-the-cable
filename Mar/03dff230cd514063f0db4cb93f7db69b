The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Gombe says it is targeting over one million votes in the March 18 governorship election in the state. Ayuba Aluke, spokesperson of the PDP campaign management council, spoke on Friday at a press conference in the state. Aluke said the party is working to win the governorship and state house of assembly elections with a margin that has never been recorded before. He said the victory recorded in the February 25 national assembly election in which the PDP won five seats in the house of representatives and two senatorial seats was an indication of the party’s acceptability in the state. “What the PDP is targeting is not just victory, but we want to win with a margin that has never been attained in Gombe state,” Aluke said. “We are targeting over a million votes, and by God’s grace, we will make it. “We have presented our manifesto to the people of the state and they have seen it and judged us based on our commitment and what the PDP governorship candidate in the state — Jibrin Barde — has done. “The people know what the PDP has done and is doing in the state and that gives us confidence that victory is ours.” The data released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) shows that Gombe has 1,575,794 registered voters, with 1,534,954 collected permanent voters cards (PVCs). The PDP is seeking to snatch power from Muhammadu Yahaya, the incumbent, and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). TheCable reported that Yahaya recently apologised to the Christian faithful in the state. Yahaya, who is seeking re-election, tendered the apology during a meeting with leaders of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Gombe state chapter, held at the Government House.
