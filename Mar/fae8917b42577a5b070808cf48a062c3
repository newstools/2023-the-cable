Ahmed Makarfi, a former governor of Kaduna, has alleged that the state government is planning to arrest some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a statement issued on Thursday, Makarfi said the plan by the All Progressives Congress (APC) led-government in the state includes arresting and detaining 80 members of the PDP till after the election. The  Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed the governorship and state houses of assembly elections to hold on March 18. Makarfi’s claim comes hours after Saidu Adamu, an assistant director of the PDP governorship campaign council in Kaduna, was arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS). Adamu was arrested on Wednesday alongside El Abbas Muhammed and Talib Mohammed, PDP youth leaders over allegations of incitement. Markarfi said those listed for arrest are from Kudan, Sanga, Igabi, Lere, Kachia, Jaba, and Kaduna north LGAs of the state. “Our attention has been drawn to a list of 80 of our field officers, drawn up by the government to be arrested and detained until after the elections. This has grievous implications,” the statement reads. “Adamu is still in detention and we don’t know the alleged offences. He has also not been charged to court, it is a very sad development.” In a separate statement, Ibrahim Wusono, PDP secretary in Kaduna, called for the release of the three PDP chieftains. Wusono said the APC is intimidating members of the opposition in the state. “We condemn the intimidation and harassment of our members and demand their immediate release,” the statement reads.
