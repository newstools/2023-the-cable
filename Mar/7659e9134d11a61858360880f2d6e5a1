Orji Kalu, the senator-elect for Abia north, has announced that his mobile phone was stolen during the collection of certificates of return in Abuja. On Tuesday, 98 senators-elect in the February 25 elections were presented with their certificates of return by Mahmood Yakubu, the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), at the International Conference Centre (ICC), Abuja. In a statement on Thursday, the former governor of Abia advised members of the public to beware of any illegal activity that may be carried out using his phone, noting that he has reported the incident to the appropriate quarters. “This is to notify the general public to beware of any illicit activity involving my cell phone and numbers,” Kalu said. “During the collection of certificates of Return at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, my cell phone with MTN and Glo lines was stolen by a yet-to-be-identified person(s). My network providers have been duly informed. Please don’t hesitate to provide any useful information.” Meanwhile, less than a year ago, the phone of Namadi Sambo, a former vice-president, was stolen by a yet-to-be-identified person during an event in Abuja, despite his heavy security details. The theft was said to have happened at the book launch of the late Solomon Lar, the former governor of Plateau state.
