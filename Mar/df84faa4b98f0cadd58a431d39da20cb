Over 200 Boko Haram fighters have been reportedly killed by the rival Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) during a clash around Gudumbali, Borno state. Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency publication, said the ISWAP fighters had targeted hundreds of the Boko Haram members and their families while fleeing from attacks. The publication said the displaced Boko Haram fighters scampering for safety were displaced to the Gwoza, Konduga, Mafa, Dikwa, Gajiram, and Lake Chad shores. It quoted a military source familiar with the development as saying that the ISWAP fighters intercepted the fleeing Boko Haram elements at Choliye village where 200 of them – including their women and children — were killed. “In Yale, a village in Konduga LGA, ISWAP Commander Modu Bashir Okocha led another team of ISWAP to attack another Boko Haram position, and as a result, killed 15 of them, seizing their weapons and motorcycles,” the source said. “The fierce onslaught had forced hundreds of the Boko Haram fighters and their families to surrender to the troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Mafa, Konduga, and other parts of the Theatre while some of them managed to flee through Mafa to Dikwa, Abadam, as well as the Niger Republic in the Lake Chad region. “Some of the fighters escaped to the camp of Bakura Wulgo, aka Abou Oumaymah, in the axis of Marte and Krenowa while others ran to the Mandara Mountains in Gwoza to seek refuge and protection from Ali Ngulde.”
