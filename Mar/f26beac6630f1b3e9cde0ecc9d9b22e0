The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) says it will close runways 18R and 36L at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos for maintenance. FAAN disclosed this in a tweet on Monday. The agency said work on the runways will span for eight weeks. It also assured that normal airlines’ activities would not be affected, as the taxi way B-18L would be used for all flight operations. “This is to notify the public that runway 18R/36L of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos has been closed for 8 weeks for Maintenance work to carried out,” the statement reads. “Taxi way B-18L will be used for all flight operations.” Checks on NOTAM, a notice containing information essential to personnel concerned with flight operations, shows that the runaways have already been closed and scheduled to be opened in May 2022. In June 2022, the agency had closed runways 18L/36R of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), for renovation for 90 days. During the period the runways were closed, airline operators said they incurred huge losses due to the shut down, despite assurances by FAAN that operations would not be affected.
