Nigeriaâ€™s Flying Eagles have steamrolled Tunisia 4-0 to clinch a bronze medal in the 2023 U20 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt. The Nigerians bounced from the disappointment of the semi-final loss to The Gambia and showed rare sharpness in front of the goal to blow away the Tunisians at the Cairo International Stadium on Friday. Nigeria got the first goal in the ninth minute when a determined run took Daniel Bameyi to the byline of the Tunisian goal area and his pullout was neatly tucked in by Ibrahim Muhammed. Although Flying Eagles continued to dominate the game, a second goal did not arrive until immediately after the start of the second half. Ahmed Abdullahi paid for the penalty miss in the semi-final as he slotted home a cute finish off a tuck-on by Muhammed. Two minutes later, an audacious solo run from Jude Sunday made it three for Nigeria. He slalomed through a sea of Tunisian defenders, despite the shoving and chasing, before smashing the ball into the bottom right corner. Sunday got his second of the game and made it a complete rout in the 90th minute. He scored a sublime strike after cutting into the area from the left. The Flying Eagles had already booked a place in the U20 World Cup billed for Indonesia later in the year. Meanwhile, Senegal will take on The Gambia in the final of the U20 AFCON on Saturday.
