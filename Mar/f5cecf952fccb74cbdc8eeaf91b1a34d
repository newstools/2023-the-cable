Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has called on political, religious, and traditional leaders in the country to drive their followers toward the pursuit of unity in Nigeria. While speaking at the Archbishop of Abuja Unity Cathedral, Methodist Church of Nigeria on Sunday, Osinbajo said the church is a place to deliver people from fear, oppression, and eternal damnation — a place of succour, joy, and encouragement. He said leaders in all climes should encourage their followers in the pursuit of truth and justice. “We must continue to build churches and places of worship knowing that everywhere we plant a church; we establish the light and power of the gospel of the love of Jesus Christ,” Osinbajo said. “The light and power are the answers to darkness, pain, and misery of our world. The forces of evil and hate are more virulent than ever; the battle between light and darkness is more intense than ever, but the church will prevail. “We need to unite. We call on politicians, religious and traditional leaders, and all in authority to do the right thing.” In his remarks, Oliver Ali-Aba, the prelate of the church, said the church would continue to spread the gospel and pray for the country. “The church wants to carry on as Christ has charged on the great commission; to spread the gospel and to do well. We pray for Nigeria’s unity, peace, and development; we pray for good leaders from the church to the nation at all levels.’’
