The Labour Party (LP) has criticised Umaru Mustapha, governorship candidate of the party in Adamawa, for allegedly asking supporters to vote for Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the presidential election. Christopher Nicolas, Adamawa LP chairperson, at a press briefing on Thursday said prior to the election, Mustapha asked his supporters to vote for the APC standard bearer. The Adamawa LP chairperson however thanked supporters of the party for voting for Peter Obi, the party’s presidential candidate. He also called on the supporters of the party to vote for candidates of the party contesting for seats in the state house of assembly. “On behalf of our president, national chairman, we thank our supporters for the votes given to us, we appreciate you all,” NAN quoted Nicolas as saying. “We equally encourage you to vote for candidates contesting for state assembly under our great party. “While for governorship, we are working on it because he came out publicly and denounced our boss, and called his supporters to vote for APC which is an offence for us.” On his part, Joseph Maigari, the north-east zonal coordinator of the Obi-Datti presidential campaign council, said the presidential election was rigged and called on the party supporters to remain calm. “Most of the votes for LP were counted for other political parties, especially in Adamawa, which we are not happy [with] and we have the evidence to present,” he said. In the presidential poll, Adamawa was won by Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He secured 417, 611 votes to defeat Tinubu who had 182,881 votes and Obi who polled 105,648 votes. Atiku is a native of Adamawa state, where he was elected governor in 1998 before becoming the running mate of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.
