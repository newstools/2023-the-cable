The Kwara police command says an officer attached to the mobile police department has killed his girlfriend and shot himself dead over a misunderstanding. Ajayi Okasanmi, police spokesperson in the state, who confirmed the incident to TheCable said it occurred at about 8:05 am on Thursday. Okasanmi said the MOPOL officer, identified as Micheal Olalere, went to search for the lady at a Chapel of Redemption, UMCA, Agba Dam Housing Estate, Gaa Akanbi in Ilorin, the state capital. He said the police officer killed the lady who is yet to be identified before he shot himself in the head. “It is true. At about 08:05 hours this morning, we received information that a man in police uniform later identified as Sergeant Olalere Michael went to Chapel of Redemption Agba Dam housing estate in Ilorin and shot his girlfriend and also shot himself dead. It is an estate, we have a school and a church inside. That was where the incident occurred,” Okasanmi told TheCable. “He was working with the mobile police department. I believe the incident occurred as a result of a misunderstanding between the police officer and his girlfriend as there was no suicide note. “They were friends, it must be as a result of a misunderstanding or love sour. We received the information and dispatched a team of policemen there and recovered the lifeless bodies of the police officer and the woman. “They were removed and taken to the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital where they were both confirmed dead. Investigation on the incident is ongoing.”
