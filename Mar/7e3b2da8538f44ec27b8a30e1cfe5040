The police in Ogun have rescued Oluseun Oduneye, a journalist who was kidnapped in the Ijebu Ode area of the state. Oduneye, publisher of Issues Magazine, was abducted on Thursday. In a statement on Monday, Abimbola Oyeyemi, the command’s spokesperson, said Oduneye was rescued after a gun duel that lasted for about 45 minutes with the kidnappers. “The journalist was riding in his Toyota Camry car when he was attacked at about 7.50 pm on his way to Ijebu-Ode from Abeokuta,” he said. The police said the next day, the abductors called his wife with the victim’s phone,  demanding N30 million as ransom. Oyeyemi said Frank Mba, commissioner of police, had directed Murphy Salami, the divisional police officer of  Obalende divisional headquarters, to ensure the safe rescue of the victim. “In compliance with the CP’s directive, the DPO mobilised his detectives and embarked on technical and intelligence-based investigation of the incident,” Oyeyemi said. “Their efforts paid off when the Toyota Camry of the victim was traced to Idimu area of Lagos, where the kidnappers were hibernating waiting for the ransom. “On sighting the policemen, the hoodlums engaged them in a shootout which lasted for about 45 minutes before they abandoned the car and took to their heels after sustaining varying degrees of gunshot injuries. “Having realised that the game is over, the kidnappers were left with no alternative but to abandon the victim, and he was rescued unhurt.” He said the CP commended the officers for their gallantry and appealed to members of the public, particularly hospitals and traditional healers, to inform the police of anybody with a gunshot injury. The CP also warned criminals to steer clear of the state, saying the command is ready to take the fight to their doorsteps.
