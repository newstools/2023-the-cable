Rishi Sunak, prime minister of the United Kingdom, has introduced new laws to control migration to the country. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Sunak said illegal migrants would be deported and permanently barred from re-entering the UK. The new legislation, called the ‘Illegal Migration Bill’, will affect those crossing the English Channel in small boats. The prime minister said their illegal entry is unfair to those who play by the rules in Britain. Sunak added that the illegal migrants had overwhelmed the asylum system which is why they would no longer be able to claim the benefit. “Over 45,000 people illegally crossed the Channel in small boats last year. That is unfair to those who come here legally and unfair on the British people who play by the rules,” Sunak said. “The Illegal Migration Bill ensures that if you come to the UK illegally you can’t stay. “People must know that coming here illegally will result in their detention and swift removal – once they do, they will not come, and the boats will stop. “If you come to the UK illegally: You can’t claim asylum, you can’t benefit from our modern slavery protections, you can’t make spurious human rights claims, you can’t stay. “This is how we will break the business model of the people smugglers; this is how we will take back control of our borders.” If you come to the UK illegally you will be stopped from making late claims and attempts to frustrate your removal. You will be removed in weeks, either to your own country if it is safe to do so, or to a safe third country like Rwanda. pic.twitter.com/8NFaa4DbwT — Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) March 7, 2023  The new law is the latest in the UK’s aspiration to cut down migration and control its borders. TheCable had reported how policies including shortening visa validity periods and restricting dependents for foreign students had been established to control migration.
