Biodun Ajiboye, assistant director of media and publicity for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign, says the victory of Peter Obi in Lagos during the presidential election caught the party unawares. Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), placed third in the February 25 election won by Bola Tinubu of the APC. The LP standard bearer however defeated Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos, in the state, polling 582,354 votes against the latter’s 572,606. The result is considered one of the biggest upsets from the presidential election. Speaking on the matter in a chat with Arise TV on Tuesday, Ajiboye acknowledged that Obi’s victory in Lagos shocked the APC. He added that the party has, however, identified the factors that led to the defeat and will improve on them. “We were caught unaware to a larger extent. It was like an insurgence upon our political fortress. They came without us expecting but now that they have done it,” he said “We are now very much awake and know where and what to do to endure that a repeat of such calamity does not happen. People do not understand the enormity of what it would mean for the Labour Party to win Lagos state.” Obi’s victory in Lagos has thrown open the March 18 gubernatorial election in the state. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the incumbent and candidate of APC, LP’s Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour and Olajide Adeniran of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are the major contenders in the election.
