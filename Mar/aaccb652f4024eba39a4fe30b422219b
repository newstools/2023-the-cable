The Child Rights Information Bureau (CRIB) of the federal ministry of information and culture has enjoined broadcasting stations across Nigeria to allow children to be part of the programming process of Sunday. March 5 is the first Sunday of this month which is dedicated to celebrating the International Children’s Day of Broadcasting (ICDB). The ICDB was created by UNICEF in 1991. In a statement on Tuesday, Mercy Megwa, director and head advocacy of (CRIB), said the day was set aside for broadcasters around the world to create awareness of children’s issues. Megwa said it also focused on children’s hopes, dreams as they exchange ideas with their peers on several issues affecting them. The theme for this year’s celebration is “more money for primary education”. “In Nigeria, primary education is officially free and compulsory but 18 million of the country’s children aged between 5 and 14 years are not in school,” the statement reads. “Only 61 per cent of 6-year olds regularly attend primary school. Adequate funding of primary education will create an enabling environment for increased demand for qualitative education which is the bedrock of enhanced knowledge, improved behaviour and personal growth of the children.” The statement further enjoined broadcasters to open airwaves to the children for this year’s
celebration while also producing documentaries that highlight the plight of children in Nigeria.
