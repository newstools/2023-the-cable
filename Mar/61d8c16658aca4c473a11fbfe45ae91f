Ireti Kingibe, the senator-elect for the federal capital territory (FCT), has promised to increase the number of women occupying appointive and elective positions in the FCT. NAN reports that Kingibe spoke in a statement issued on Friday to commemorate the 2023 International Women’s Day. She said some active women have been identified in the FCT and would be appropriately trained for leadership positions in the country. While saying that women deserve more support to thrive in political roles, Kingibe said the decline in the number of women elected into national assembly positions is ridiculous. “The amount of money that flies around in politics scares away good female politicians, thereby, paving the way for wrong candidates to emerge,” she said. “The decrease in the number of women elected into the national assembly as shown by the results of the February 25 presidential and national assembly elections is ridiculous. “We have seven female senators and 11 members of the house of representatives in the outgoing 9th national assembly. “Now, we are going to have only three female senators and 15 female members of the house of representatives in the 10th national assembly. “This is unbelievable, considering our numerical strength. We, women, must do more for ourselves, we must rise and support our fellow women for the country’s democracy to be balanced and effective.” The senator-elect urged the federal government to implement the 35 percent affirmative action for women, adding that female politicians deserve more opportunities.
