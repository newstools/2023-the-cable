Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo state, says corruption trials should not be the “exclusive preserve” of the federal government. Speaking during the inauguration of the state anti-graft agency on Tuesday, Akeredolu said corruption cases that fall within the purview of states should be prosecuted by the state government. He urged members of the state anti-graft agency to beam their searchlight on the public service and follow due process in their line of duty. “The commission of certain offences is local. Corruption trials should not be the exclusive preserve of the federal government. Stealing is also an offence against the state,” the governor said. “Therefore, if an allegation of crime falls within the purview of the state’s criminal jurisdiction, it is proper that the trial be conducted in the place where the offence is committed. “This commission is expected to combat crime effectively. Intelligence gathering should commence from the execution of the state budget passed into law. It is basic. “It is our hope that this body will be able to track budgetary allocations for the benefit of the people. “All other engagements should focus on ensuring that the monies appropriated and released are utilised in the interest of the people. “There are other matters ancillary to this basic function. Corruption, as a social vice, has a wide spectrum. The unwholesome activities of public servants must come under close scrutiny. “There is, virtually, no area of public service that has not been infested with this virus. It is a shame that the state still battles to know the exact figure of those she owes obligations as workers.” Apart from Ondo, Kano state also has an anti-corruption agency. Most corruption cases in the country are handled by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC).
