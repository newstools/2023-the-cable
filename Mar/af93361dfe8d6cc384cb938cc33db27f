Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Igbo socio-cultural organisation, has dissociated itself from a media report that Peter Obi was not destined to be Nigeria’s president. The report was allegedly signed by Tony Chiemelu Obizoba, director general, implementation and strategic planning, Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly Worldwide. Alex Ognonnia, the national publicity secretary of the group, said in a statement on Monday, that the organisation was rather impressed by the performance of Obi during the February 25 presidential election. “The attention of Ohanaeze Ndigbo has been drawn to a mischievous publication being circulated in the media, that Peter Obi is not destined to be Nigeria’s president,” the statement reads. “As a body, we are impressed, thrilled, and fascinated by the groundswell and intimidating support for the Obi-Datti movement. “For the purpose of clarity, Ohanaeze Ndigbo vehemently dissociates itself from any remark suggesting that Obi is not destined to rule Nigeria. NAN reports that the organisation described Obi as a man with a track record of efficient performance in governance and business. The group expressed worries over the pervasiveness of social media in spreading fake news. On Wednesday, March 1, Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was declared the winner of the 2023 presidential election with 8,794,726 votes. Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) came second with 6,984,520 votes, while Peter Obi polled 6,101,533 votes to come third.
