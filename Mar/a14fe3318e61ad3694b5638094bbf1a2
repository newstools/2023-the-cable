Ali Ndume, senator representing Borno south district, says the 10th national assembly will have a hitch-free relationship with Bola Tinubu, the president-elect. Ndume spoke in Abuja on Monday after a meeting between the leadership of the All Progressives Party Congress (APC) and national assembly members elected under the platform of the party. Among those present at the meeting were Tinubu, Orji Kalu, senator-elect for Abia north, Ahmad Lawan, senate president, Abdulaaziz Yari, former governor of Zamafara state and senate-elect, Adams Oshiomhole, former governor of Edo state and Godswill Akpabio. Speaking on the incoming national assembly, Ndume said Tinubu would decide on the leadership of the 10th assembly at the appropriate time. “The meeting ended up well. That is what we are expecting from the party. We did an assessment of our performance and also go back home to ensure that we take the victory to the end. Nigerians have spoken and decided to elect APC and we have some ups and downs as usual in every electoral process,” he said. “The party appealed to NASS members elect to play down the leadership issues and focus more on ensuring that we take the election battle to the end. And that is to ensure that we win our states. So the party has charged us and agreed that interactions like these should be frequent to allow us to go in the same direction to avoid the bad experiences of 2015 and 2019. “The issues of zoning did not come up. The Nigerian Government now is going to be the national assembly government because the President, Vice President, Party Chairman, and Secretary are all senators. So we are going to have a rancor-free relationship. “What we agreed is the members of the national assembly should produce their leadership based on who they think is the best and also considering the issues at stake and putting in place justice, fairness, and equity. The President-elect will at the appropriate time take his decision.”
