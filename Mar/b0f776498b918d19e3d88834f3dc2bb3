Chelsea have qualified for the quarter-finals stage of the UEFA Champions League (UCL) following a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund in their second-leg encounter at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night. Goals from Raheem Sterling and Kai Havertz helped Chelsea overcome a 1-0 first-leg deficit to progress 2-1 on aggregate. The Blues, who have been a shadow of the club that won the UCL in 2021, hit the post early on through Mateo Kovacic and eventually took the lead on the stroke of halftime through a well-placed Sterling shot from Ben Chillwellâ€™s cross. The English fullback was also involved early in the second half as his cross was handled in the area for a penalty converted by Havertz at the second attempt. The win seals a third consecutive appearance at the last-eight for Chelsea. The Blues also scored two goals in a match for the first time since December 27, 2022. Elsewhere, Benfica also advanced to the quarter-finals following a 5-1 second-leg win over Club Brugge in Portugal to seal a 7-1 aggregate victory.
