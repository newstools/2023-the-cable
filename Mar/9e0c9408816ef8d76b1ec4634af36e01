Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo state, has approved the increment in the pension allowances of retirees in the state. Kayode Ogundele, the state’s head of service, announced the development on Monday in Akure, the Ondo capital. Ogundele said the approval was in conformity with the consequential adjustment arising from the implementation of the national minimum wage act. In 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari signed the minimum wage act that approved N30,000 for both federal and state workers. Ogundele said no fewer than 11,654 officers from the state civil service and 11,659 from the local governments’ service who retired before January 1, 2020, would benefit from the new approval. While congratulating the pensioners in the state, he thanked Akeredolu for listening to the yearnings of the pensioners and prioritising the well-being of workers. On his part, Abiodun Akinseloyin, permanent secretary of the state’s pension transition department, described the approval as a welcome development, saying it would go a long way to enhance the living conditions of the retirees.
