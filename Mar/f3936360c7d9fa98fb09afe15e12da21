The Rivers police command had said 12 persons died after the incident at the Rumuekpe community in Emuoha local government area of the state. Giving an update, Adande said a breach on the TNP was discovered following a joint investigation by representatives of oil regulators, host communities, operators, and the state ministry of environment. “The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) confirms with great sadness that the fire incident, which occurred on Friday, March 3, 2023, on the Rumuekpe – Nkpoku Trunk Line in Rivers State, resulted in the unfortunate loss of lives,” he said. “Government security agencies are still investigating to know the exact number of lives lost in the incident.
