The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) says operations in loading depots across the country have fully resumed. Farouk Ahmed, chief executive officer (CEO), NMDPRA, in a statement on Sunday, said the resumption followed restrictions of movements during the recently concluded presidential and national assembly elections. Ahmed explained that due to the elections, truck drivers had to travel to exercise their civic duty. “Consequently, the NMDPRA is working with other Stakeholders to mitigate the slight tightness being experienced in the distribution of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS),” he said. “Most importantly, the public is invited to note that the current stock sufficiency stands at 35.39 days for PMS, 34.86 days for AGO and 31.36 days for ATK. “The Authority continues to strive towards guaranteeing supply and distribution reliability nationwide and strongly advises against panic buying.” Meanwhile, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited had given reasons for the resurgence of petrol queues in parts of Abuja. “The appearance of pockets of queues in Abuja and some parts of the country, is largely due to restrictions in businesses and movement, to allow for the conduct of the presidential and NASS elections to enable Nigerians to exercise their civic right,” Garba Deen Muhammad, NNPC spokesperson, had said. “However, operations have now resumed at the depots and trucks are being dispatched to various parts of the country.” Ahmed said he expects normalcy to be restored in the next few days.
