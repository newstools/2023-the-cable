Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Lagos, says winning the state will give birth to a new kind of politics in Nigeria. On March 18, Rhodes-Vivour will contest with Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the incumbent and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Olajide Adediran of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the governorship election. Speaking at an event in Ikeja on Thursday, Rhodes-Vivour said if elected governor, he will lift many Nigerians, particularly Lagosians, from poverty. He said electing him will mean setting a new standard for politicians in Nigeria, adding that there will be a stop to the status quo in leadership. “We know that the goal and what we are going through is far bigger than I and any of us,” he said. “It is a project that will lift the lives of millions of Lagosians up and in turn lift the lives of many Nigerians up. It is a project to free Lagos from the shackle hold of tyranny. “A Lagos state where the inner roads will work, where our people will have quality healthcare, water, quality public education, not one where parents keep struggling trying to find how to pay school fees for their children to go to private school. “We are already 90 per cent there. We need to bring this thing home. I want you to understand that the moment we take Lagos, this fire of a new type of politics will engulf Nigeria. “You start to find politicians that mean well for the people, that can articulate their vision and are positive about change.” Rhodes-Vivour added that “we are changing the narrative to have a new Lagos and a new Nigeria”.
