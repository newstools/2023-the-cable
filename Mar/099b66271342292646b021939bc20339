A federal high court in Lagos has granted leave to Labour Party (LP) to apply for a mandamus order mandating the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to electronically transmit results during the March 11 governorship and house of assembly elections in the state. The order was issued on Friday by Peter Lifu, the presiding judge. The judge also issued a mandamus order compelling INEC to enforce Section 27(1) of the Electoral Act 2022 in the distribution of election materials by hiring impartial, qualified, and dependable logistic companies that are not partisan. Lifu made the orders while ruling on a motion ex-parte marked: FHC/L/CS/370/2023. The motion was filed by the Labour Party, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, its governorship candidate in Lagos, and 37 others. The applicants had approached the court through their lawyer, Abass Ibrahim. The substantive matter has been fixed to be heard on March 7.
