The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos has described the endorsement of Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, governorship candidate of the Labour Party(LP), by Afenifere,  as a “laughable charade”. On March 18,  Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos and candidate of the APC, will contest against Olajide Adediran of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and Rhodes-Vivour of LP, for the governorship seat of the state. In the build-up to the election, Afenifere, the Yoruba social-cultural group declared support for the candidature of Rhodes-Vivour. However, in a statement on Thursday, Seye Oladejo, the spokesperson of the APC in the state, said the endorsement of the LP candidate by the group is irrelevant and borne out of bitterness for the incumbent. “Our attention has been drawn to a laughable charade called the endorsement of the Labour Party’s Lagos state governorship candidate by the factional leader of Afenifere, Chief Supo Shonibare,” Oladejo said. “We will ordinarily have ignored this non-event but it will be a disservice to the general public if the records are not set straight. “The so-called endorsement by a group of attention-seeking and a politically irrelevant group of people is ominous as they have consistently backed the wrong horse out of malice, envy, bitterness and political frustration. “Our political history is replete with many victims who lost elections as a result of the backing of these people who lack electoral value. “The most recent was the Labour party’s presidential candidate, Mr  Peter Obi who’s now facing the reality of their valueless support.”
