Liverpool’s strikers produced a blistering second half display to humiliate Manchester United 7-0 in their English Premier League (EPL) clash at Anfield on Sunday. The fierce rivals put on an exciting show and it was Liverpool that triumphed with the trio of Mohamed Salah, Cody Gapko and Darwin Nunez scoring braces before Roberto Firmino added the seventh to consign Manchester United — fresh from lifting the Carabao Cup last weekend — to a humiliating defeat. Casemiro had a goal ruled out for offside for Man United and this spurred Liverpool on. The Reds took the lead on the stroke of halftime when Gapko latched on to Andy Robertson’s through ball before curling into the corner. Jurgen Klopp’s men resumed the second half the same way they ended the first, scoring through Nunez, the on-fire Uruguayan striker, who finished off after the hosts pounced on a sloppy back pass by Man United’s defence. Gapko put the tie beyond United on 50 minutes with a deft, clipped strike to finish off a counterattack led by Mohamed Salah. The Egyptian would plant a one-time shot into the net for his 11th goal against Man United on 66 minutes before Nunez completed the rout with a header ten minutes later. Further goals for Salah and Firmino completed the rout. The result is Man United’s worst in all competitions in 92 years since losing by a similar scoreline to Wolves in 1931. The stinging defeat is the Red Devil’s first loss in 12 matches in all competitions and the first loss in five EPL games. The rejuvenated Liverpool move up to fifth on the EPL log with 42 points from 25 matches, three points away from the much-coveted fourth position. Man United remain third with 49 points, nine points behind Man City, their local rivals. Elsewhere, Alex Iwobi lasted 89 minutes as Everton were held to a 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest who continue to miss Taiwo Awoniyi due to injury.
