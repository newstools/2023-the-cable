Yoruba traditional rulers, under the aegis of the Yoruba Obas Forum, have congratulated Bola Tinubu, President-elect, on his victory at the February 25 presidential election. In a communique issued at the end of their executive meeting on Saturday, the traditional rulers asked Tinubu to use his victory to unite the country. The communique was jointly signed by Samuel Adeoye, the molokun of Atijere, Michael Odunayo, the elerinmo of Erinmo, and Abdulrazaq Abioye, the olukotun of Ikotun-Ile. The monarchs asked other presidential candidates to support the President-elect for the development of the country. They commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the conduct of the presidential and national assembly elections. “We call on those who lost in the elections to accept the outcome in good faith, put any differences aside, and join hands with the winners for the overall benefit of the country,” the traditional rulers said. “Tinubu’s vast experience in the organised private sector, his dexterity in managing a hugely populated cosmopolitan state like Lagos, his struggle along with others to achieve today’s democracy that we all enjoy will go a long way to make his presidency a success. “We, Yoruba Obas, also want to call on the President-elect to consider giving constitutional roles to traditional rulers in the country. “We believe this will go a long way to bring the dividends of democracy closer to the rural areas and also in curbing insecurity in the country, as we are the chief security officers of our various domains.” On March 1, INEC declared Tinubu as the winner of the presidential election amid protest from opposition parties.
