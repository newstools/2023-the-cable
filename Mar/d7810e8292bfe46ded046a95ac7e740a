Remi Osinbajo, the driver of the BRT bus that collided with a train, leading to the death of six people, has asked families of the victims for forgiveness. On March 9, a train collided with a Lagos state staff bus conveying workers, in the Shogunle area of Oshodi, Lagos. Witnesses at the scene said the bus was attempting to cross the rail track when an oncoming train rammed into it and dragged the bus from Shogunle to the PWD area of Ikeja. Shortly after the incident, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the governor of Lagos, on a visit to Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) confirmed that six people died from the incident. Speaking after the incident, Osinbajo blamed the incident on mechanical faults that affected the bus. “It was not my fault. How could I have ignored warning signs? The bus had a mechanical fault,” he was quoted to have said. “It is a pity this has happened. I beg everyone affected to please forgive me in the name of God.” Meanwhile, on Friday, the driver was said to have been handed over to the state criminal intelligence and investigations department (SCIID). According to Moyosore Onigbanjo, the Lagos attorney-general and commissioner for justice, the staff bus driver is being investigated by the railway police command headquarters. “The commissioner of police, the railway police command has taken over the investigation of the accident,” the statement reads. “The bus involved in the collision had been retrieved and sent for a thorough examination at the Lagos state vehicle inspection service office and the ministry of justice (MOJ).”
