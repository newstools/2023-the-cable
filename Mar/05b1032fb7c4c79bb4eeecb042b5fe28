The New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) says it will sanction any of its members that form an alliance with any political party ahead of the March 11 governorship and state assembly elections. In a statement on Sunday, Agbo Major, national publicity secretary of the party, said members should remain “focused, campaign vigorously, and ensure they sweep” the elections across the country. “Our great party is not in any alliance with any political party in these elections,” the statement reads “Accordingly, party officers, members, and candidates at all levels are not authorised to discuss, negotiate or form any alliance with any political party for the purpose of winning the upcoming gubernatorial and legislative polls. “Anyone who endorses a candidate of another political party will be sanctioned in line with the NNPP Constitution ranging from suspension from office, suspension from the party, and possibly expulsion.” Major said that NNPP was registered by INEC in 2002 and had been expanding its frontiers in the nation’s political space in each electoral circle. He said that the party performed far more than the number four position INEC allotted to it in the presidential election. Rabiu Kwakwanso, the presidential candidate of the NNPP came third in the February 25 election. The party won only Kano state with 997,279 votes to defeat Bola Tinubu, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who polled 517,341 votes. Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) scored 131,716 votes while Peter Obi, candidate of the Labour Party (LP) got 28,513 votes. The party also won at least 11 seats in the house of representatives.
