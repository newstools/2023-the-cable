President Muhammadu Buhari has lauded Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo on his 66th birthday. In a congratulatory message by Femi Adesina, his spokesperson, Buhari commended Osinbajo for the “sterling services” he has rendered to Nigeria. “Buhari lauded the sterling service the celebrant had provided to the country, as an academic, attorney-general of Lagos state (1997-2007), and Vice President (2015 till date),” the message reads. “He applauded the deft way Osinbajo, a pastor with the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), had combined scholarship with governance, and pastoral work.” The president, therefore, recommended Osinbajo’s dedication to “the younger generation whom the Number 2 man serves as a torchbearer to”. Buhari wished the vice-president and his family a joyful celebration, and “greater grace” ahead.
