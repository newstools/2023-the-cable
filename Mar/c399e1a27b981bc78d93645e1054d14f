Bola Tinubu, the President-elect, says his administration will be based on the principles of rule of law and fairness. Tinubu spoke on Thursday when members of the national working committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) visited him in his Abuja residence. The former Lagos governor said he promised to work for the growth and development of the country during his campaign. The President-elect said he is committed to uniting the country, noting in any democratic contest, there would be winners and losers. “We drew a strong commitment with Nigerians. From the primary we were transparent,” Tinubu was quoted as saying in a statement by Abdulaziz Abdulaziz, his media aide. “We were committed to our ideals. We promised Nigerians that if we win we will work for all Nigerians. “I am committed to uniting the country. Definitely in any contest, particularly a democratic contest, there must be losers and winners.” He called for unity in building a government acceptable to the people. “It is going to be a fair government guided by the rule of law, justice, and fairness,” Tinubu said. “It is going to be hard work from day one and we are going to join hands in building a government of the people and by the people.” On Wednesday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Tinubu as the winner of the 2023 presidential election.
