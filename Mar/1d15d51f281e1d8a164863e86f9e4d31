Philip Agbese, a member-elect, says the victory of Bola Tinubu, president-elect, is a defeat to those seeking to “truncate” the country’s democracy. Agbese, a candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue state, was elected to represent Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadigbo constituency in the house of representatives. On Wednesday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced the former governor of Lagos as the winner of the presidential election. Tinubu secured 8,794,726 votes to defeat Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who got 6,984,520 votes, and Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) who polled 6,101,533 votes. In a statement on Wednesday, Agbese said Tinubu needs to hit the ground running because he has an enormous task before him. “Tinubu’s victory is historic – a big win for Nigerians and defeat for enemies of the nation who are out to truncate our nascent democracy,” he said. “The president-elect must work for all Nigerians irrespective of any inclination and must be a father to all.” Agbese said the president-elect should be magnanimous in his victory. “The struggle for a greater nation rests squarely on the new crop of leaders elected across Nigeria,” he said. “Nigerians have toiled enough and now is the time to forge a new cause of development and progress.” The member-elect expressed confidence that the 10th national assembly would work with Tinubu to deliver on his promises.
