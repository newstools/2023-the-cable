Mu’azu Sambo, minister of transportation, says he is saddened by the accident that involved a train and a bus in Lagos on Thursday. The accident involved a moving train and a BRT bus belonging to the Lagos state government. Six persons were confirmed dead while many others were injured in the accident that occurred at the PWD bus stop in the Shogunle area of Lagos. Witnesses at the scene reported that the driver of the BRT bus was attempting to cross the rail track when the oncoming train ran into it. Fidet Okhiria, managing director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), had said the bus driver is to be blamed for the accident. He said the driver had attempted to cross the rail track and beat the train, while other cars had stopped. Sambo, in a statement issued by Henshaw Ogubike, director, press and public relations of the ministry, called for a quick and complete investigation into the accident. “We are saddened by the news of the accident which occurred this morning involving a train operated by the Nigerian Railway Corporation and a Lagos state staff bus, conveying workers to their offices in the early hours of today in Shogunle, Lagos,” the statement reads. “We pray for those who have lost their lives that the Almighty God should grant them eternal rest and we pray for a speedy recovery to the injured.” The minister also condoled the families of the victims, the Lagos state government, and the people of the state. He expressed appreciation for the concerted effort of the Lagos state government, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), and the general public in assisting to clear the area where the accident happened and helping to provide immediate treatment for those injured.
