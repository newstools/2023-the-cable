Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo state, says Bola Tinubu, the president-elect, has set up a committee to meet with presidential candidates of other parties for reconciliation. He said the committee comprises elders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Akeredolu spoke on Wednesday in Abuja during the presentation of the certificate of return to Tinubu and Kashim Shetima, vice president-elect. Tinubu secured 8,794,726 votes to defeat Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who got 6,984,520 votes, and Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) who polled 6,101,533 votes. In a statement signed by Richard Olatunde, his chief press secretary, Akeredolu said the election reflects the wishes of the electorate. The governor added that every aggrieved person will be met for reconciliation. “The president-elect has set up committees to meet with the gentlemen who contested in the election for us to start the healing process. I belong to one of the committees. We are going to meet them and appeal to them so that we can work together,” he said. “This is an election that was not padded. People who voted were counted, that is the way I see it, not one which shows millions of votes. You can see the candidates, everyone won 12 states each, it has never been like that before.” The governor said the votes recorded by APC candidates in Ondo show the love of the people for his administration, adding that the people “willingly” supported his clamour for a southern president “Ondo people are progressives and we will always, at least, be on the side of progressivism. From the onset, we were at the forefront of clamour for a southern president and so we have to put everything we had into it and we got the support, that is why we are able to make it,” he said.
