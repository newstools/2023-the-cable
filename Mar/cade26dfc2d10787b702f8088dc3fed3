The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council says it welcomes the move by Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi, presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party (LP), to challenge the election. At separate press conferences on Thursday in Abuja, Obi and Atiku said they would contest the victory of Bola Tinubu, standard bearer of the APC. Reacting on Friday, Dele Alake, the APC campaign’s media adviser, said the claims that the bimodal voter verification system (BVAS) was not used during the election is false because Abubakar and Obi were accredited by the device. “Let us say, unequivocally, that we welcome the decision of both the PDP and LP and also the NNPP candidates to test their claims, as ridiculous as they are, in the court of law as provided for by our constitution,” Alake said. “This is without prejudice to the conciliatory efforts of the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “He has reiterated in his post-declaration speeches the need for all Nigerians, irrespective of whom we all voted for, to rally quickly together for the good of our country. “What we did not expect is that the two presidential candidates and, indeed, their political parties, would shamefully re-echo the puerile and unimaginative arguments that are being canvassed by political illiterates and mischief-makers who are crying wolf on social media. “Save for the bad losers that these two people have proven to be, we should rather be celebrating the tremendous improvement the use of BVAS has brought to our electoral process.” Alake said the APC administration would continue to do all it can to ensure that it makes the country good for all citizens.
