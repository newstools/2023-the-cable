The Labour Party (LP) has appointed Hilda Dokubo as the chair of its three-man steering committee in Rivers state. Julius Abure, national chairman of the LP, announced the appointment in a letter sent to Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Thursday. Abure said the committee would serve for a period of one month. The letter said Philip Loveday and Gogo Wellington would serve as the secretary and publicity secretary of the steering committee respectively. “Following the tenure expiration and dissolution of the caretaker committee led by Dienye Pepple, a three-man steering committee is hereby appointed as follows: Hilda Dokubo – chairman; Pastor Philip Nyechi Loveday – secretary; Mr. George Wellington – publicity secretary,” the letter reads. “The appointment is for one month. Consequently, this letter suspends any other letter relating or connected thereto.” The appointment of the steering committee comes after the LP chairman dissolved the leadership of the party in the state over alleged anti-party activities. TheCable had reported the dissolution of the leadership of the party over alleged anti-party activities and mismanagement of the party’s funds. The development came after Deinye Pepple, the then LP Rivers chairman, endorsed Sim Fubara, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state.
