The Ogun state chapter of the Accord Party says it didn’t adopt Dapo Abiodun of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as its governorship candidate. Ogun, like 27 other states, will go to the polls on March 18 to elect a governor and house of assembly members. Speaking with journalists, on Saturday in Abeokuta, Tajudeen Olayokun, Accord Party chairman, said the party’s adopted candidate remains Ladi Adebutu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said one Adebisi Adewale who led a faction of the party to announce the adoption of Abiodun was expelled from the party in 2022. “The party decided to throw its weight behind a reliable candidate with competence, character and goodwill in the interest of the people of the state,” Olayokun said. “Our members should disregard anything contrary. We don’t have anything to do with APC. We are happy that Adebutu, the governorship candidate of the PDP, is trusted and shares the same ideology with us. “I would like to bring to the notice of the good people of Ogun state, that the Ogun state Accord party remains cordial with Oladipupo Adebutu of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on his candidacy comes March 18, 2023, as our governorship candidate. “The news of Accord Party, Ogun state pitching tent with APC in the state should be thrashed and we hereby distance ourselves from such lies.”
