Riess Nelson scored a last-gasp winner as Arsenal came from two goals down to defeat Bournemouth 3-2  in their English Premier League (EPL) fixture on Saturday. Goals from Thomas Partey and Ben White had cancelled Bournemouth’s goals by Philip Billing and Marcus Sensi before Nelson scored with the last kick of the game. It took the visitors only nine seconds to take the lead as Billing’s shot found the back of the net before Sensi’s header doubled the lead on 57 minutes. Partey started the comeback, converting from close range on 62 minutes before White made it 2-2 on 70 minutes with a right-footed shot. Nelson, who assisted the second goal, planted his shot into the bottom right corner to win it for Arsenal at the death. Arsenal maintain their five-point lead at the top of EPL with 63 points from 26 matches. Elsewhere, Chelsea won their first league match since January with a 1-0 victory over Leeds United at Stamford Bridge. Wesley Fofana’s second half header was enough to spare Graham Potter’s blushes in an uninspiring victory. It is also their first league win in six outings. Earlier in the day, Manchester City overcame Newcastle United 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in the first game of the weekend. Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva both scored to secure a win that maintained the Champions’ five-point deficit behind Arsenal, the league leaders. RESULTS
