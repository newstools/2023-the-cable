Chukwudi Ogbonna, the Accord Party (AP) candidate for Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni state constituency for Rivers state assembly, has been abducted by gunmen. Ifeaka Nwakiri, a relative of the politician, confirmed the abduction to TheCable on Tuesday morning. TheCable understands that Ogbonna was kidnapped on Monday at Rumuigbo, near Port Harcourt, the Rivers state capital. Nwakiri said the abduction is “politically motivated”, adding that Ogbonna was driving a white Mercedes car with a friend when he was kidnapped. “The abduction has been reported to the police and other security apparatus,” he said. “He was driving with his friend. They double-crossed him. His friend came out of the car to understand what was happening then the gunmen started shooting in the air so the young man had to scamper for his safety. “Up till now, we don’t know his whereabouts.” When contacted for comment on the incident, Grace Iringe-Koko, the Rivers police spokesperson, said an update will be provided soon.
