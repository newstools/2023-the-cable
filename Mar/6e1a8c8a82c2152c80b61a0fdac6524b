Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta, says the Obidient movement is not about the Labour Party (LP) but was borne out of religion and ethnicity. The Obidient movement originated in 2022 following the huge social media popularity of Peter Obi, LP candidate in the 2023 presidential election. Speaking to journalists in Asaba on Monday, Okowa said many factors led to the emergence of the movement, including the idea that the Igbos must produce the next president. “Many factors led to the emergence of the [Obidient] movement which included religion, the argument that the Igbo must produce the next president, and the quest that the presidency should shift to the south,’’ he said. Speaking about Sheriff Oborevwori, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, the governor said he supports his candidacy. He mentioned that Oborevwori was victorious at the party primaries held on May 25, 2022, and so was chosen by the people. “I will continue to support the candidacy of Oborevwori. There was a primary conducted in which he scored 590 votes to emerge the winner, so he is my choice. “We are in a democracy where people make choices. Oborevwori was chosen by the people so I will continue to support him. “I promised to push the democratic process forward by ensuring free and fair elections in the state.”
