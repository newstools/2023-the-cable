Erling Haaland scored a second half penalty to hand Manchester City a precious 1-0 win over Crystal Palace in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Selhurst Park on Saturday evening. The Norwegian’s penalty ensured Man City got a deserved three points in a match they dominated but were denied by Vincent Guiata in Palace’s goal. Pep Guardiola rested Kevin de Bruyne and Paul Walker but still had enough in the tank to ensure victory sealed in the 78th minute after İlkay Gündoğan was bundled in the penalty area. Haaland converted for his 28th league goal of the season. The victory moves City to within two points of Arsenal who are due to play on Sunday. Elsewhere, Liverpool followed up their 7-0 mauling of Manchester United with a surprise 1-0 defeat at Bournemouth in the first match of the day. Mohamed Salah missed a second half penalty for Liverpool to ensure Phillip Bilking’s 28th-minute goal was enough for the relegation-threatened Cherries to claim a precious win. Chelsea made it back-to-back EPL victories with a 3-1 win at Leicester City. RESULTS
