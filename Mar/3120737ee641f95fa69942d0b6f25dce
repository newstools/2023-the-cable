Suleiman Hunkuyi, governorship candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in Kaduna, has asked residents of the state to reject politicians promoting religious and tribal sentiments. Speaking while addressing journalists in Kaduna, on Saturday, Hunkuyi asked residents to be circumspect of candidates soliciting votes by whipping up sentiments. The NNPP governorship candidate said using religion or tribal antics in a complex state such as Kaduna for electioneering is dangerous to democracy. Hunkuyi said religious organisations ought not to publicly endorse candidates of political parties because it could cause division. He said the endorsement of governorship candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by some clerics in the state is deceptive. Hunkuyi asked residents to vote for a credible candidate that will prioritise development if elected. “Where do we go from here when a governor that will emerge after the poll will be tagged a governor for Christians or a governor for Muslims in this metropolitan state?” Hunkuyi asked. “Kaduna state is known as the centre of learning. Therefore, I don’t expect any sensible person whether citizen or other residents of the state to be carried away by religious and tribal sentiments.” The NNPP governorship candidate added that he wants to see a Kaduna “where nobody is treated as a second-class citizen for the purpose of peace and unity; progress, growth and development”.
