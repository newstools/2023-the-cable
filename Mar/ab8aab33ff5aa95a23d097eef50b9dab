Not less than 26 fishermen have been reportedly killed by suspected fighters of the Islamic State’s West African Province (ISWAP). The attack took place in Mukdolo village, Gamborun Ngala, Borno state. According to Zagazola Makama, a publication focused on the Lake Chad region, the fishermen were ambushed, tortured and killed. Military sources told the publication that dozens of terrorists on motorcycles invaded the village on Wednesday and shot sporadically. The sources said at least nine of the fishermen managed to flee while three sustained bullet wounds. The gunmen were said to have surrounded those unable to escape, subsequently torturing and killing them. “They asked them to lay down. Thereafter, they used their fishing net and wrapped it around them before they started torturing them. After they became unconscious, they opened fire at them, killing them instantly,” a source told Zagazola Makama. The bodies of the 26 fishermen were later recovered during a search and rescue operation by troops who received the news from victims who escaped. The victims of the attack are expected to be buried on Thursday. The attack comes a week after the troops of operation Hadin Kai intercepted and killed a commander of the jihadists and some of his fighters in Mukdolo.
