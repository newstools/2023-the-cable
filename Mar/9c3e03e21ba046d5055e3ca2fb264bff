The defender showed brilliant defensive displays and was a steady outlet which earned him man-of-the-match performances against Egypt and Mozambique. Njoku, on the other hand, was also a lynchpin of the team at the right back. He was pivotal in Nigeria’s 1-0 win over Uganda in the quarter-finals and the victory secured a place for Nigeria in the 2023 U-20 World Cup. Senegal defeated The Gambia 2-0 on Saturday to win the competition in Egypt.
