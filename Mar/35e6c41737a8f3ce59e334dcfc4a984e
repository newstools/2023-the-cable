Adeyeye Ogunwusi, the Ooni of Ife, has asked Bola Tinubu, the president-elect, to assemble a team of intellectuals and professionals to come up with an economic recovery blueprint for Nigeria. Ooni made the call in a congratulatory message to Tinubu on Wednesday. In the message signed by Moses Olafare, director of media and public affairs at the palace, Ogunwusi said Tinubu should hit the ground running and show Nigerians that he is ready for the job. “You must immediately assemble a transition team of cerebral men and women to come up with an economic recovery blueprint upon your inauguration on May 29,” he said. “You must move into action in a way that will further assure Nigerians of the ‘Renewed Hope’. “As a tested and trusted cerebral team leader that you are, you must, in a couple of days, present your transition team of cerebral men and women to give us an economic recovery blueprint. “Nigerians have voted for you because of your promise of a Renewed Hope and you must swiftly, from your first day in office, set the ball rolling in a manner that will further assure Nigerians of the ‘Renewed Hope’.” The monarch described Tinubu as “a progressive workaholic” who deserved the electoral victory. “You have adequately proven capacity to lead the country to an enviable position in the global committee of nations,” he said. “I congratulate you and your amiable wife on behalf of the Oduduwa race worldwide as you have victoriously emerged as the president-elect of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “You are indeed a man of destiny, you are a game changer and you are a progressive workaholic who has worked assiduously with the right strategy and tactics justifying the merit of your recorded victory.”
