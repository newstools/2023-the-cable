Operatives of the Lagos police command have arraigned Okechukwu Chukwunahi, a 44-year-old landlord, for allegedly taking the names of two of his tenants to a herbalist’s shrine. NAN reports that Chukwunahi was charged to a magistrate court in Ojo, on Tuesday. The police charged him with conspiracy and trial by ordeal. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. Simon Uche, the prosecution counsel, told the court that the defendant committed the offence in February at Ira quarters. He said Chukwunahi took the names of the tenants to “Arusi Okija” shrine after they had a misunderstanding. Uche said the tenants received a call from the priest of the shrine they were reported to, informing them to come to his place in person or risk death. The prosecutor said the nominal complainants are Onyeka Ibeabuchi and Chimezie Ezeuka. He said the defendant had initially referred the misunderstanding between him and his tenants for mediation and later to a court in Badagry.  But he resorted to trial by ordeal at the shrine because he was not satisfied with the outcome of the court and the mediation. The police prosecutor told the court that the offence contravenes the provisions of sections 127 and 411 of the criminal law of Lagos state, 2015. Delivering judgement, J.K Layeni, the magistrate, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N300,000 with two sureties and adjourned the trial to March 20.
