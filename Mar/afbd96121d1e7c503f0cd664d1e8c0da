President Muhammadu Buhari has called on Nigerians living in Doha, Qatar to support Bola Tinubu, president-elect, as he takes over the reins of government on May 29. Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson, said Buhari spoke at a town hall meeting on Tuesday. Buhari said his administration facilitated credible, transparent and fair elections which will be concluded on March 11, with the governorship and state assembly elections. He called on Nigerians in the country to “support the incoming government of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, so that Nigeria will continue to be the beacon of hope and prosperity in our continent and an example for other African countries to emulate”. Buhari acknowledged “the noble roles” that Nigerians in the diaspora have been playing in the development of the country. He said his administration had approved a national diaspora policy, and supported the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) to develop programmes for the “ambassadors” of the country to contribute their quota towards the development of their fatherland. Yakubu Ahmed, Nigerian ambassador to Qatar, congratulated Buhari for conducting a “successful” presidential and national assembly elections. Ahmed said the process has proven that Nigeria’s democracy is indeed strong. He noted that Nigeria and Qatar have maintained a brotherly bilateral relationship since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 2013. He said there are currently about 7,000 Nigerians residing in Qatar, and gainfully engaged in diverse areas of human endeavours. “I’m proud to inform you, Your Excellency that majority of our nationals in Doha are professionals who have excelled in their chosen careers, playing critical roles in healthcare, safety, oil and gas, aviation, construction, among other sectors,” he added.
