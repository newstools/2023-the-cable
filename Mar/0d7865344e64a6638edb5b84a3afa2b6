Six people have been confirmed dead from the accident involving a train and a Lagos state staff bus. The accident took place on Thursday morning between the Shogunle and Ikeja axis when the staff bus veered into the rail track and was crushed by an oncoming train. Many passengers were injured in the accident and some were taken to the trauma centre of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH). Speaking with journalists at LASUTH, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the governor, said four of the victims were confirmed dead at the hospital. The governor said blood donors are needed for the victims while he called on Lagos residents to come to their aid. TheCable had earlier reported that two people died at the scene of the accident. Meanwhile, Fidet Okhiria, managing director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), said the driver is to be blamed for the accident. “According to the information I gathered at the scene of the incident, they said many cars stopped when they got to the level crossing while the Lagos State Staff Bus driver continued moving, which I don’t know why,” the NRC boss said. “Maybe the driver thought he could pass before the train got nearer to him. He could not pass, and then the train crushed the bus; that is what we gathered. “The train was coming from Ijoko to Iddo.”
