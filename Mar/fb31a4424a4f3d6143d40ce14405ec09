President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the Flying Eagles to win the ongoing CAF U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt. Nigeria will face The Gambia on Monday in the semifinals of the competition. The Flying Eagles have already secured a ticket to the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Indonesia in May, having made it to the last four. Sunday Dare, minister of sports and youth development, who delivered Buhari’s message to the Nigerian players and officials in Cairo, urged the team to aim for the ultimate prize. “Mr President and indeed the whole of Nigeria are proud of what you have already achieved. That is why he has asked me to come here to see you,” the minister said on Sunday. “The target is to win a World Cup ticket and you have done that. You are nearer the trophy now, so take it step by step and become African champions again,” he also said.
