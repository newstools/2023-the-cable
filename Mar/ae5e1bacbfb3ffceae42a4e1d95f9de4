The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) has announced the 15-month debarment of Ogon-Asu Company Ltd, a Nigerian construction company, and William Ogon, its chief executive officer, over “fraudulent and obstructive practices”. In a statement on Thursday, the development finance institution said the debarment took effect from February 24, 2023. A debarment renders firms/individuals ineligible to participate in contracts financed or administered by the AfDB for the stipulated period. “An investigation conducted by the Bank’s Office of Integrity and Anti-Corruption established that Ogon-Asu Company Ltd. engaged in fraudulent practices during a tender for the Provision of Equipment and Construction of Axle Load Scales/Weigh Stations along Enugu-Abakaliki-Mbok (Ogoja Junction) – Ikom-Mfum Road in Nigeria, a component of the Transport Facilitation Programme for the Bamenda-Mamfe-Ekok/Mfum-Abakaliki-Enugu Road Corridor in Cameroon and Nigeria,” the statement reads. “The investigation further established that Mr. William Tuku Ogon engaged in an obstructive practice during the investigation. “The Transport Facilitation Programme for the Bamenda-Mamfe-Ekok/Mfum-Abakaliki-Enugu Road Corridor is expected to increase trade and strengthen cooperation between countries of the Central African States and those of the Economic Community of West African States in general, and between Cameroon and Nigeria, in particular.” The institution said during the debarment period, Ogon-Asu Company Ltd alongside its affiliates and CEO would be ineligible to participate in AfDB-financed operations and activities. “At the expiration of the debarment period, Ogon-Asu Company Ltd., its affiliates and Mr. William Tuku Ogon will only be eligible to resume participation in African Development Bank Group-financed operations and activities after they implement an integrity compliance program consistent with the Bank’s guidelines,” AfDB added.
