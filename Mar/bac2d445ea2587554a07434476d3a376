Abdullahi Sule, governor of Nasarawa, has warned that the state will not tolerate religious crisis. Sule spoke on Saturday in Lafia, Nasarawa capital, during a meeting with the leaders of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI), and Sidi Bage-Mohammed, the emir of Lafia and chairman of the state traditional council. The governor is seeking a second term in office. He said the meeting was called owing to “the dangerous religious dimension of ongoing politics” ahead of the March 11 elections. Sule condemned some inciting and provocative videos that went viral on social media promoting religious politics. He praised the religious and traditional leaders for the peaceful conduct of the presidential and national assembly elections in the state. He attributed the success of the elections to the efforts of all stakeholders and urged them to ensure that the forthcoming election is also peaceful. The governor said the government would not allow anybody to divide the people and destroy the state because of politics. “Nasarawa state has always been seen as a peaceful place and there are Muslims and Christians in virtually every family. So, the government cannot allow religious crisis in the state,” he said. “If the state is not peaceful, even those inciting people cannot have the time to send those messages, as everybody will be on the run. “Power comes from God and He gives it to whoever He wants at any time, so, as politicians, we should only present ourselves to the people.” He appealed to religious leaders to talk to their followers to desist from any act capable of breaching the peace in the state.
