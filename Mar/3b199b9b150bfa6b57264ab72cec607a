Bola Tinubu, president-elect, has congratulated Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo on his 66th birthday. In a statement on Wednesday, Tunde Rahman, Tinubu’s aide, quoted the former governor of Lagos state as describing him as “a remarkable intellectual in public service”. The president-elect said Osinbajo has worked with President Muhammadu Buhari to deliver social investment programmes to Nigerians. “I rejoice and celebrate with our Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, on the attainment of 66 today,” he said. “Professor Osinbajo has been a remarkable intellectual in public service since he served with me in Lagos as attorney-general and commissioner for justice. He contributed immensely to the success of our administration and led our justice sector reforms. “As the vice-president of our country, Professor Osinbajo has partnered very well with our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, to deliver on the progressive programmes of our party to make life better for Nigerians especially in areas of massive infrastructural development and life-changing social investment programmes. “On this special day, I join his immediate family, friends and political associates to wish him continuous good health. “Many happy returns dear Professor Osinbajo.” In the build-up to the just concluded presidential election, Osinbajo was one of those who contested for the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). However, Tinubu defeated the vice-president, his longtime ally, to clinch the ticket.
