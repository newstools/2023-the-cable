The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) says it will continue to arrest and prosecute those involved in the production and circulation of fake redesigned naira notes. Speaking in an interview with NAN in Abuja on Sunday, Ahmed Audi, NSCDC’s commandant-general, said the number of cases of fake naira notes circulation had become worrisome. TheCable had reported that NSCDC said it arrested members of two syndicate groups allegedly involved in the production and distribution of counterfeit United States dollars (USD) and new naira notes. Audi warned perpetrators to desist from the act, adding that the corps would not relent but continue to arrest and prosecute those involved in economic sabotage of the country. He said while interrogating most of the arrested suspects, it was deduced that the alleged fraudsters took advantage of the low circulation of the redesigned naira notes to massively produce counterfeit notes. “Many innocent Nigerians must have fallen victims to their scheme while they collected bank money transfers and exchange of foreign currencies,” Audi said. “The arrest of this syndicates will help us fish out more criminals who have decided to take advantage of the economic situation in the country to scam people.” Audi, therefore, advised citizens to avoid being victims of fraudsters by ensuring they transact with banks, most especially when large sums were involved.
