Uba Sani, the All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial candidate in Kaduna state, says he’ll build and equip two more primary healthcare centres (PHCs) each in all the 255 wards in the state if elected. Speaking on Saturday during a phone-in radio programme, Sani said Nasir El-Rufai, the state governor, has done his best by providing a PHC in each of the 255 wards in the state. Sani said he had also helped to equip seven PHCs in Kaduna north, Kaduna south, Kajuru and Chikun as well as Igabi and Giwa area councils. The gubernatorial candidate said he would complement the governor’s efforts by providing two additional PHCs in each ward, equipping as well as staffing them  with relevant medical personnel. “At Birnin Gwari LGA, I have constructed and equipped a whole modern Obstetrics and Gynecology Centre,” Sani said. Speaking on his achievements, the candidate said apart from sponsoring a record number of 32 bills at the upper legislative chambers, he has also provided hostels and skills acquisition centres across the state. “I have built and equipped an ICT centre at Government Senior Secondary School, Kawo in Kaduna north LGA, another one at Government Secondary School, Maimuna Gwarzo, at Kaduna south,” he said. “Last month, I laid the foundation of an ICT centre at Kudan LGA to ease the hardship that students encounter  when writing JAMB. They have been going to Zaria to write this examination for several years. “Remember, this is the local government of the gubernatorial candidates of PDP and New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP), people who held public service positions in the past.”
