The Ogun police command says it has recovered the corpse of Oreoluwa Fatinoye, the son of a couple allegedly killed by assassins on January 1. Abimbola Oyeyemi, the command’s spokesperson, confirmed the development on Tuesday. Oreoluwa’s parents, Kehinde and Bukola Fatinoye, were found dead at their residence located within Ibara government reservation area (GRA) in Abeokuta. The incident was said to have happened shortly after the couple, who were employees of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), respectively, returned from a church service to usher in the new year. The building belonging to the couple was also set ablaze, while Oreoluwa and a maid were reportedly kidnapped. On Monday, the remains of the couple, who were burnt beyond recognition, were buried. According to NAN, Oreoluwa’s body was found floating in a river along Adigbe-Obada road in Abeokuta, the Ogun capital,  on Tuesday morning. His hands were also said to have been tied with rope when his corpse was discovered. Idowu Taiwo, a fisherman, said he discovered the body floating in the river while he was preparing for the day’s work. “On Monday, we heard that someone was thrown into this river. But this morning, while we were preparing for work, the police approached us and pleaded with us to inform them any time we discover the body,” NAN quoted Taiwo as saying. “But, this morning, around 7:30, we discovered the body while checking our equipment in the river. “I called someone to help us get the number of the PPRO (police public relations officer) to tell him that we have discovered the body. “Not long after, the police came and we showed them the body after we had brought it to the river bank.” The police later took the corpse away in the presence of some family members of the deceased.
