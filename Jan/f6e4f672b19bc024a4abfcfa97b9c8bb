Uche Ikonne, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abia, is dead. A party chieftain confirmed the development to TheCable on Wednesday. Uche Ikonne, the deceased’s son, also announced the development in a statement on Wednesday. He said his father died on Wednesday morning at the National Hospital, Abuja, after a brief illness. “He was recovering after taking proper treatment in the United Kingdom but relapsed a few days ago, leading to multiple cardiac arrests from which he didn’t recover from,” the statement reads. “Further details and arrangements would be made known to the public after deliberations and meetings are made within the family.” The late PDP gubernatorial candidate was the former vice-chancellor of the Abia State University (ABSU). He polled 468 votes in the Abia governorship primary held in May 2022, to defeat five other contestants. Lucky Igbokwe came a distant second with 45 votes, while the only female contestant, Ngozi Merenge, scored five votes.
