Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president, has called on countries around the world to name one of their stadiums after Pele, the late Brazilian football legend. Pele, fondly nicknamed the “king of football”, passed away last week after battling colon cancer. In Brazil, a 24-hour public wake began on Monday at the Santos’ Urbano Caldeira Stadium in honour of the three-time World Cup winner. Speaking at the procession, Infantino identified the best way to immortalise Pele and his impact on football. “We’re going to ask every country in the world to name one of their football stadiums with the name of Pele,” the FIFA president said.

The walk will continue to his final resting place at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica cemetery, where family members will hold a private funeral. TheCable had reported that Pele’s 100-year-old mother is still unaware of her son’s death. According to Maria Lucia do Nascimento, sister of the Brazilian football legend, their mother still “doesn’t know the situation” and remains “in her own world” with little awareness about the news.
