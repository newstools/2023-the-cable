Festus Keyamo, the spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council, has asked law enforcement agencies to prosecute Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The APC presidential campaign council had earlier asked law enforcement agencies to arrest the PDP candidate based on an audio recording released by Michael Achimugu, a former aide to Abubakar. In the audio, the former vice-president is alleged to have explained how shell organisations were set up to divert public funds. TheCable has not confirmed the authenticity of the recording in question. In a letter addressed to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), and the Conduct of Conduct Bureau (CCB), on Monday, Keyamo said he was acting for himself as a “concerned Nigerian”. He asked the agencies to commence the prosecution of Abubakar within 72 hours, adding that by Achimugu’s “evidence”, the former vice-president is guilty of violating sections 5, 10, 13, and 17 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act. Keyamo also alleged that Abubakar is in violation of section 18(2) of the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022, and section 96(1) of the Penal Code. He said the PDP candidate does not enjoy immunity against prosecution, adding that he would institute a suit against the agencies if they fail to prosecute Abubakar. “Take notice that because this matter is of great national importance, I expect you to act with alacrity and a sense of duty within seventy-two (72) hours of the receipt of this petition,” the letter reads. “Take further notice that if you fail, refuse and/or neglect to act, I shall be proceeding to court to compel you to act. “The ball is in your court and Nigerians are waiting and watching.”
