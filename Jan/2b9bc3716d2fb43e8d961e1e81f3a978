The federal executive council (FEC) has approved over N10 billion for projects in the aviation sector. FEC gave the approval on Wednesday at a meeting presided over by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in Abuja. Hadi Sirika, minister of aviation, said the council approved N7.4 billion for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Hadejia airstrip in Jigawa state for a period of 18 months.
