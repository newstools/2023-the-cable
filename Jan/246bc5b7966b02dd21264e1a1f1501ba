Hope Uzodinma, Imo state governor, says he will ensure insecurity and threats from non-state actors do not affect the conduct of elections in the south-east. The governor spoke in Owerri on Thursday while addressing government liaison officers and other election coordinators. TheCable had reported that in the southern region of the country, the south-east zone recorded the highest number of reported deaths in 2022. The report also indicated that insecurity could threaten the conduct of the upcoming elections and may ignite voter apathy. However, Uzodimma said his government will not take insecurity lightly, especially during the elections. He maintained that elections must be held in south-east states, regardless of the threats by non-state actors. “Nothing, not even threats from the non-state actors will stop elections from holding in Igboland,” he said. “I will be changing entirely the kids-gloves approach with which the issues of insecurity are being handled. “I wonder why a people so blessed like us could channel our skills to destruction and killings. This is certainly not our identity. There must be a way out.” He assured Imo residents of improved security, adding that they should remain law-abiding and be ready to exercise their franchise at the polling units.
