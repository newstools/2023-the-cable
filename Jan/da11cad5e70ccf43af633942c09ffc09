Valentine Ezike, identified as a Nigerian residing in the Philippines, has been arrested for allegedly being in possession of illicit drugs. The Philippines News Agency, in a report on Sunday, said the Philippines Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) arrested Ezike on Saturday at the regional office 4-A in Barangay Biclatan, Cavite, Philippines. Authorities were said to have seized around 500g of suspected shabu, a box containing two resealable transparent plastic bags containing more or less 1000g each of brownish granules substance, plastic basin containing weighing scale, four identification cards, among others. ‘Shuba’ is a slang term for methamphetamine in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. PDEA said the suspect is believed to be a member of a West African drug syndicate that recruits Filipinos to transport illegal drugs. Ezike is expected to be charged for alleged violation of sections 5 and 11, Article II of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The Philippines Act establishes offences and penalty according to the different dangerous drugs, regardless of the quantity and purity involved. Under the law, anyone guilty of importation or sale of dangerous drugs, manufacture of illegal drugs, or with the operation of a drug den can be punished with either life imprisonment, death, or a huge fine.
