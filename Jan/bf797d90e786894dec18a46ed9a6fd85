The Kogi police command says its officers repelled an attack by suspected gunmen on Lokoja-Obajana road of the state. The gunmen were said to have attacked travellers on the road on Wednesday. Speaking with TheCable on the incident, William Aya, the Kogi command spokesperson, said officers were deployed to the scene of the attack. “It was an attempted attack, and I can confirm to you that no one was shot. The police were quick to arrive at the scene,” he told TheCable. “The gunshot by the men attracted the police officers who were nearby and they were able to repel the attack and rescue all the travelers. None of the travelers was wounded or kidnapped.” The development comes amid attacks on communities across the state in recent months. On December 21, 2022, gunmen killed two officers attached to the Kogi police command, in an attack along the Agbaja road in Lokoja, the state capital. The officers killed were said to have been on a routine patrol.
