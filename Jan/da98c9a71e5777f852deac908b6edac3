The All Progressives Congress (APC) ended its campaign rally in Bauchi state on Monday abruptly following a technical glitch. The rally, which was held at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa stadium in Bauchi, had President Muhammadu Buhari in attendance. The president is expected in Lagos later on Monday on a two-day working visit, and he is billed to inaugurate a number of projects. The Lekki deep sea port and a rice mill in Ikorodu are among the projects to be inaugurated by the president. The rally began experiencing a technical glitch that affected the microphone when Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the party, was making his remarks. Adamu had just established protocol and began to deliver his remarks in Hausa when he could no longer be heard by the crowd. Equipment were said to be overheating. Senate President Ahmad Lawan could be heard describing the situation as “sad”. “And there is no alternative?” he asked. After battling to resolve the issue with no end in sight, the president went on the podium and presented Sadique Baba Abubakar, APC gubernatorial candidate in the state, a flag. After that the president was escorted to his motorcade and he departed the venue of the rally, marking an end of the event.
