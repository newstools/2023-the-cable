Mohammed Dingyadi, minister of police affairs, says there is no issue concerning Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police (IGP), reaching retirement age. The IGP will clock 60 on March 1, 2023, and according to his profile, “he was commissioned into the Nigeria Police Force on 15th March, 1988, as a Cadet Assistant Superintendent of Police at the prestigious Nigeria Police Academy (Annex), Kaduna”. The retirement age for public service officials is 60 years or after 35 years in service. The presidential and national assembly elections are scheduled for February 25, while that of governorship and state assemblies will hold on March 11. Speaking on Wednesday while answering questions from journalists on the expected retirement of the IGP, the police minister said the “issue does not arise”. “I don’t know where you got your record, but by the provision of Police Act 2020, the IGP is now supposed to have a tenure of four-year period and Mr. President has given him letter of appointment in that regard,” Dingyadi said. “So, the issue of the IG going out during this election period does not arise.” Baba was appointed as IGP in April 2021. Meanwhile, Baba’s predecessor, Mohammed Adamu, also faced a similar issue prior to his leaving office. President Muhammadu Buhari had extended Adamu’s tenure by three months after he reached the mandatory 35 years in service in February 2021. The matter was, subsequently taken before the federal high court in Abuja, and the court affirmed Buhari’s decision on the grounds that the constitution gives the president the power to appoint the IGP. According to the court, by implication of the powers of appointment, the president can extend the tenure of an IGP who is due for retirement, pending consultation with the police council on the approval of a substantive replacement.
