Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, the Nollywood actress, has condemned the level of suffering in Nigeria. The actress took to Instagram on Friday to lament the situation of things in Nigeria while comparing it with what is obtainable in the United States. The ace actress, who relocated with her family in 2021, said living in the US has opened her eyes to the “needless sufferings in Nigeria”. The country’s economy gasps for breath as food price hikes and fuel scarcity continue to persist. Insurgents, bandits, and kidnappers are also threatening the well-being of citizens. Joining the fray, Omotola said that the irregularities Nigerians condone are “pure craziness”. “After living in the US now for about 2 years.. Not just visiting but living and changing systems..I now see many things we managed and let slide is just pure craziness,” she wrote. The 44-year-old also wondered why people must suffer to get anything done in Nigeria. “I’m deeply frustrated at the depth and volume of the needless suffering Nigerians go through,” she added. “We are too intelligent a people to suffer like this. Suffering is not lessons to brag about … it’s evil. Why must people suffer to get anything done? Why?” The award-winning film star made her Nollywood debut as the leading actress in ‘Venom of Justice’ in 1995. Since then, she has established herself as a prominent figure in the country’s entertainment industry. Omotola has appeared in over 300 films and received so many domestic and international awards.
