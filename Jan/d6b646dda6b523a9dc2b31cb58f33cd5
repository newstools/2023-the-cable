Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, has approved the release of 11 convicts in the state. According to a statement by the state government, the governor announced the pardon during the 2023 countdown celebration organised by the Kaduna capital territory authority (KCTA). He said the pardon is in line with the prerogative of mercy powers conferred by section 212 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). Based on the recommendations of the state advisory council, the convicts who benefitted from the pardon included Shamsu Usman, Abdullahi Abdulmumuni, Mahadi Abdullahi, Futune Mabuke, Abdullahi Lawal, Sunday Iliya , Mohammed Anas, and Kayode Gabriel Adenji. “Kaduna State Advisory Council on the Prerogative of Mercy based its recommendations on convicts serving sentences of three years or more who have six months or fewer to serve, long term prisoners who have served ten years or more of their sentence with good conduct, and convicts suffering from ill health likely to terminate in death,” the statement reads. “The committee also considered private submissions for clemency made to the governor.” El-Rufai also wished the people of Kaduna a happy new year and appealed to them to be optimistic despite tough times. He thanked the people of Kaduna for the opportunity to serve them, and for their understanding and support during his tenure. The governor also asked for continued commitment to peace and prosperity, adding that “the hard work done since 2015 to make the state better and improve lives will continue with the next government”. El-Rufai will complete his second and final term as governor by May 2023.
