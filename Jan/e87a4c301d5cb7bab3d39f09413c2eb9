Alex Iwobi, Super Eagles of Nigeria midfielder, suffered what appears to be a serious knee injury as Manchester United defeated his Everton side 3-1 in their English FA Cup third-round tie at Old Trafford on Friday night. The Nigerian international midfielder was seen stretchered off early in the second half after being unsuccessfully treated by physios for several minutes. Antony gave Manchester United the lead in the 4th minute before Connor Coady equalised for Everton ten minutes later. Coady would however score an own goal before Marcus Rashford’s penalty sealed a victory that knocked out the struggling English Premier League (EPL) club. Iwobi’s injury happened two minutes into the second half when he latched on to a poor Casemiro pass to burst forward, but the former Arsenal midfielder was brought down by Tyrell Malacia. The tackle, however, saw Iwobi twist his right ankle before crumbling to the turf in agony. Abdoulaye Dacoure replaced the rejuvenated 25-year-old who could face weeks or months out injured. Iwobi has featured prominently for Everton this season, playing 21 matches with a return of one goal and six assists.
