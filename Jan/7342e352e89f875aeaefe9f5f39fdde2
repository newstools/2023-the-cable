Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says if elected, his administration will ensure that the crude oil discovered in Bauchi is used judiciously. In October 2019, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited (formerly Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation) announced the discovery of crude oil, gas, and condensate in the Kolmani River region at the border community between Bauchi and Gombe states. In November 2022, President Muhammadu Buhari flagged off the first crude oil project in the north-eastern part of the country. Speaking on Thursday during his party’s campaign rally in Bauchi, Obi told residents of Bauchi that the oil discovered in the state would not be for sharing but for development. He also said his administration will prioritise security. “We cannot achieve anything if the country is not secured, and it would be the top priority of Datti and me to secure the land and return the people to the farms,” Obi added. “Datti and I have the key to unlocking the wealth of the north, which is embedded in the vast arable land in the region.” The LP candidate added that the hide and skin industry in the state will be developed and turned into a centre for exportation. Obi, along with Datti Baba-Ahmed, his running mate; Julius Abure, national chairman of LP, and other party members also visited Rilwanu Adamu, the Emir of Bauchi. See photos below.
