A federal high court in Ikoyi has granted permission to Oladipo Shasore, former Lagos attorney-general to travel abroad for medical treatment. In October 2022, Shasore was arraigned on a four-count charge before Chukwujekwu Aneke, judge of a federal high court in Lagos. The former AG was alleged to have committed money laundering to the tune of $100,000 without going through a financial institution. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. The former Lagos AG had filed an application seeking permission to travel to London for medical care. The defense team, led by Paul Usoro, said Shasore was diagnosed with lattice retinal degeneration to both the left and right eyes as well as chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment to the right eye. The diagnosis reports, issued by Tom H. Williamson, a consultant ophthalmologist at the London Claremont Clinic of St. Thomas Hospital London, were attached as Exhibit SS3. Bala Sanga, prosecution counsel, did not oppose the application. “Only the living can stand trial,” Sanga said. Consequently, the judge granted the application. “The application praying this court’s discretion to travel for medical treatment in London, the United Kingdom, dated 30th of December, 2022, without opposition, is hereby granted as prayed,” the judge held. The case has been adjourned to February 21 for continuation.
