The United States mission in Nigeria says the goal to eliminate HIV/AIDS by 2030 is achievable. The US said it has expended over $7.8 billion to support HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria with accessible medical services through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) initiative. The US said Nigeria is moving towards achieving HIV/AIDS-free society, adding that 95 percent of patients are aware of their status, while those diagnosed are receiving treatment for the disease. “The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) will mark its 20th​ anniversary.​PEPFAR​ is​ the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history and represents the best of American values. Over the past 20 years, the United States has invested over $100 billion in the global fight against HIV/AIDS and supports more than 20.1 million people on HIV treatment in over 50 countries globally,” the US mission said in a statement on Saturday. “Our two decades of investments have changed the course of the​ HIV​ pandemic by controlling it without a vaccine or a cure. Through PEPFAR,​ we have laid the groundwork for the eventual eradication of HIV. “In Nigeria, PEPFAR has disbursed over $7.8 billion to ensure that all Nigerians living with HIV/AIDS have comprehensive access to quality HIV prevention, care, and treatment services. This investment translates​ to​ providing​ over 1.9 million Nigerians​ with access to​ antiretroviral treatment (ART). “Today, Nigeria is on the cusp of HIV epidemic control and is approaching the global “95-95-95” goals defined as:​ 95% of people with HIV know their HIV status, 95% of those with diagnosed HIV infection are accessing treatment, and 95% of those receiving treatment have achieved an undetectable viral load. “Our commitment to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 is an ambitious but achievable goal.​”
