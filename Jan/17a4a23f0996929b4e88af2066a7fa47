A federal high court in Abuja has dismissed a suit filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) seeking the disqualification of Muhammad Yahaya as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe state. The PDP alongside two persons, Muhammed Barde and Timothy Danlele, had prayed the court to disqualify Yahaya on the grounds that the certificate he submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to support his bid for re-election was forged. Delivering judgment on Tuesday, Binta Nyako, the presiding judge, held that the suit was incompetent. She described the plaintiffs as meddlesome interlopers who lacked the locus standi to institute the suit. Nyako held that the plaintiffs neither participated in the primaries nor were they members of the APC. Consequently, the judge said the court lacks the jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
