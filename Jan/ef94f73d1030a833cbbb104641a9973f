Naj’atu Muhammad, a former senator representing Kano central, has been seen with Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Muhammad visited Abubakar on Sunday in Abuja where she reportedly pledged to support the former vice president’s presidential bid. There is no official comment on her pledge to Abubakar but while quitting the ruling party, the politician said she was committed to supporting individuals truly interested in addressing the root causes of Nigeria’s challenges. “Quitting party politics at this point in time is one of such steps,” she had said in a statement on Saturday. “We all recognise that Nigeria is facing many challenges, including insecurity, poverty, inequality, and lack of access to basic services. “Such challenges require the consolidated efforts of competent and patriotic leadership across every level of governance. Nigerians must be aware of the severity of their situation after the dismal failures of leadership the country has experienced over the years. “Nigerians must be aware of the consequences of their decisions and their choices. “Therefore, restricting one’s choice to a single political party will be detrimental to the development of our country and our democracy. “As a Nigerian fighting for a better Nigeria, I am deeply committed to the struggle for a more just and equitable society. I believe that all Nigerians deserve the opportunity to live a life of dignity, security, and opportunity.”
