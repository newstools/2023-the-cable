Kola Abiola, the presidential candidate of the People’s Redemption Party (PRP), has promised to make a 25% provision for women and People With Disabilities (PWDs) if he’s elected president in the coming election. Abiola said this on Saturday during a rally to commence campaigns for all candidates vying for elective positions in Kebbi state. “As a party, we will make sure that what we promised in our manifesto is fulfilled, every state we control will have 25 per cent of women and people with disabilities (PWDs) in the cabinet of every state,” he said. “We intend to run a true federalism as contained in our manifesto. We will make sure we implement everything in our party manifesto to the letter. Our role is to mentor the next generation into power.” The PRP candidate also promised to address insecurity in the country. He said, “to live better, we must collectively work towards a peaceful country we will call ours.” In his remarks, Attahiru Jega, a PRP chieftain, said the state is affected by poor governance, adding that there is a high number of unemployed youths in the state. Jega urged residents of the state to vote for the PRP, adding that the party has tested and trusted candidates at national and state levels that can make a positive impact.
