The convoy of Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue state, has been involved in an auto accident. The incident occurred on Friday morning when the convoy was heading for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship campaign rally in Utokon community, Ado LGA of the state. No casualty has been recorded but a source informed TheCable that some persons were injured, including three lawmakers of the state house of assembly. The party official added that the lawmakers were taken to the hospital and are in “stable condition”. Those in the convoy included Benson Abounu, Benue deputy governor; Abba Moro, senator representing Benue north-east; some members of the house of representatives and state house of assembly, among other party officials. The driver of the bus which was involved in the accident was said to have swerved and collided with another vehicle. In March 2020, gunmen attacked Ortom’s convoy at Tyo Mu along Makurdi-Gboko road while he was on a visit to a farm. The attack on Ortom sparked a series of reactions from Nigerians. Narrating the incident at the time, Ortom said the gunmen, numbering about 15, trailed his convoy to the river bank where he was on foot with his security detail to inspect a farm and opened fire on them. The police later arrested 10 suspects in connection to the attack.
