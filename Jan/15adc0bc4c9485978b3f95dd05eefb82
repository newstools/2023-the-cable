The Lagos state government has announced a 10-week diversion of traffic at the old tollgate to Berger section of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Frederic Oladehinde, Lagos commissioner of transportation, said the traffic diversion will commence on Monday, January 30, and end Friday, April 15. He said the diversion is for the continuation of the rehabilitation of the road by the ministry of works. Oladehinde said the construction would be carried out in short segments to minimise inconveniences for motorists. He said traffic on the Ibadan-bound carriageway would be narrowed to two lanes to allow for the reconstruction. Oladeinde said the U-turn in front of the Lagos State Emergency Centre would be temporary closed to traffic, adding that motorists on the expressway would be diverted to the next U-turn at the old tollgate by the traffic control point. He said motorists from CMD Road intending to connect 7UP and motorways on the Lagos bound carriageway would make use of the old tollgate/traffic point Uâ€“turn as well. He said trucks and heavy-duty vehicles will be diverted to Ojota interchange. The commissioner added that traffic on CMD Road inbound the expressway will be diverted to the entry point beside the FMW weighbridge to access the expressway. He said the exit route to the expressway by Caleb International School will be temporarily closed and that the CMD Road will be used as an alternative for the displaced Ibadan-bound traffic. Oladeinde appealed to residents to shun indiscriminate stopping, waiting and parking along CMD Road so as to complement the efforts of the traffic management team that will be deployed to manage vehicular movement. He assured that signage with directions will be mounted along the road to guide motorists.
