Yakubu Maikyau, president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), has apologised to Nigerians for the failure of legal practitioners in the nation’s development. Speaking on Monday at a national dialogue on the state of the nation organised by the association in Abuja, he said most of the challenges facing Nigerians are facilitated by the neglect of duties on the part of the lawyers. “I dare say, with the utmost respect, that to a large extent, our experience today as a country is a direct result of the legal profession’s abdication of the duty to provide direction and leadership to the people,” NAN quoted him as saying. “I must, therefore, as one who is privileged to lead the Bar at this time, apologise to Nigerians for the abdication of our role. “Today, as members of the Bar, we are reputed more for how much fees we charge our clients as opposed to the discharge of our primary call to offer guidance and/or offer ourselves for the advancement of the cause of our country. “This apology is necessary because no other group of professionals is called to this privileged position as the lawyers, which also comes with a corresponding responsibility to provide leadership.” On his part, Boss Mustapha, the secretary to the government of the federation, expressed optimism that the new NBA administration will restore the profession. “I thank the NBA under its new leadership for initiating this national dialogue. This shows that you are bringing back the responsibilities restored to us as members of the legal profession,” Mustapha said.
