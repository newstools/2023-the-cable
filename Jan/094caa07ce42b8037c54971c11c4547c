The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arraigned Adebayo Aderibigbe, a former general manager and head of legal services of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), over alleged fraud. Aderibigbe was arraigned alongside one Ogundele Yisa-Yemi, a lawyer, on a  three-count charge bordering on conspiracy and obtaining the sum of N60,400,000 by false pretence. The commission alleged that Yisa-Yemi, between 2014 and 2016, gave the former NSITF general manager N60,400,000 “on account of a contract awarded to you as consultant for processing and regularising of title deeds and survey plans for the property of the fund at era village Oto-Awori. Ijanikin, Badagry Expressway, Lagos”. The offence is said to contravene section 8(1)(a) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000, and is punishable under section 8(11)(b) of the same Act. The defendants pleaded not guilty before O.A. Musa, judge of a federal capital territory (FCT) high court in Jabi. Upon their arraignment, J.A. Karon and I.O. Salawudeen, the defendants’ lawyers, prayed the court to grant their clients bail. Although the application was not opposed by the EFCC counsel, he prayed the court to set terms and conditions that would compel the defendants to show up for trial. “If the court should grant bail, we urge the court to impose terms that will ensure that the defendant comes to trial,” Faruk Abdallah, the prosecution counsel, said. The judge granted the defendants bail in the sum of N50 million and one surety each in like sum. The surety is expected to be a deputy director in a federal ministry. Sureties are also expected to deposit their letters of appointment and clear pictures of their residences showing them standing in front of the houses. The judge adjourned the matter till February 21 and 23, 2023 for trial.
