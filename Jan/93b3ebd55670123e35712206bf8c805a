The Edo office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says 661,783 permanent voter cards (PVCs) are yet to be collected in the state as of December 31, 2022. Timidi Wariowie, head, voter education and publicity of the Edo INEC office, said this on Monday in a PVC report analysis in Benin, the state capital. Wariowei said of the figure, 409,832 were old uncollected PVCs, while 251,951 were new cards. “The old uncollected PVCs were 425,239 but 15,407 had been collected, remaining the balance of 409,832,” the report reads. “Also, the new PVCs received were 289,931 but 37,980 had been collected, remaining the balance of 251,951.” Wariowei, however, said 460 PVCs were collected on January 1 across the LGAs in the state. TheCable had, in December, reported that over 1.6 million PVCs are yet to be collected in Lagos state, while over 230,000 are yet to be collected in the federal capital territory (FCT). Meanwhile, speaking earlier on Monday during an interview on ‘The Morning Show’, a programme by Arise Television, Festus Okoye, INEC national commissioner for information and voter education, had said the collection of PVCs by proxy is not allowed. “If people made efforts to register, they should also make efforts to come out and collect their PVCs. This commission will not, under any circumstance, give out any PVC by proxy,” he said.
