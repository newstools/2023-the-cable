The Osun governorship election petition tribunal has sacked Ademola Adeleke as governor of the state. In August 2022, Gboyega Oyetola, former Osun governor, and the All Progressives Congress (APC) petitioned the tribunal to challenge the election victory of Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Among several issues, Oyetola went to the tribunal that there was overvoting in 749 polling units across 10 LGAs of the state. Oyetola also challenged Adelekeâ€™s eligibility to contest the election. Delivering judgment on Friday, two out of a three-member panel of the tribunal held that the petitioner was able to prove that there was over-voting in some of the polling units. Tetsea Kume, who read the majority decision held that INEC did not comply substantially with the constitution and the provisions of the electoral act. Kume declared that Oyetola won the election, having polled 314, 921 defeating Adeleke who scored 290, 266. He ordered INEC to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Adeleke and issue a fresh one to Oyetola as the duly elected governor of Osun. The court held that Adeleke was eligible to contest the poll.
