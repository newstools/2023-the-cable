The federal government says whatever action taken against anyone who undermines the nation’s democracy is justified. Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, spoke on Monday at the 20th edition of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration scorecard series. On Wednesday, the United States announced that it had imposed visa ban on Nigerians “undermining democracy” in the country. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, had said the ban was a show of commitment to strengthening democracy in Nigeria. TheCable had reported that Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), backed the US action. Commenting on the matter, Mohammed reiterated the position of the Buhari-led administration to ensure free, fair and credible elections as well as a smooth handover to a successor on May 29. Mohammed said Buhari has given unprecedented support to INEC, adding that the scorecard series is another indication of the administration’s determination to leave office on May 29. “As a government, we are proud to say that no administration since Nigeria’s return to democratic rule in 1999, has shown more fidelity to the democratic process than ours,” he said. “No president, since 1999, has been as unambiguous as President Muhammadu Buhari, in word and in deed, with regards to leaving office after the constitutionally-stipulated two terms. “We have not been mired in any third term controversy like was witnessed under the PDP. “In fact, we are creating the template on a smooth transition of power that will guide future administrations. “Let those who undermine our democracy be sanctioned, and let them carry their own cross. As a government, we have no reason to worry because our hands are clean.”
