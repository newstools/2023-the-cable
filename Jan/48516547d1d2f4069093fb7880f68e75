Manchester United have completed the signing of Wout Weghorst, the Dutch striker, from Burnley. The deal was announced in a statement on the club’s website on Friday. The 30-year-old joins the club on a six-month loan spell that would see him stay at Old Trafford until June 2023. The striker’s wages will be covered by United, and there is no option or obligation to buy. “Manchester United is pleased to confirm that Wout Weghorst has joined the club on loan from Burnley until June 2023,” the statement reads. “Whatever happens in the next few months, I can promise to give everything to the club for as long as I am here. “I thank everyone who has played a part in getting me to this stage, and now I am looking forward to meeting my new teammates and getting involved straight away.” Eric Ten-Hag, United’s manager, earlier confirmed that the new acquisition would not be available for the Manchester derby billed for Saturday at noon.
