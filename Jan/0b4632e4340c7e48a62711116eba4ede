President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of Yusha’u Ahmed, a brigadier-general, as the director-general of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Ahmed is expected to assume office as the NYSC DG on Monday. Eddy Megwa, the NYSC spokesperson, confirmed the development to TheCable on Sunday. In November 2022, Christy Uba, director of information and communications technology, NYSC, took over the leadership of the corps in “overseer” capacity. Uba took over after Mohammed Fadah was removed from his position as director-general of the NYSC. TheCable had reported that Fadah was removed over alleged incompetence, and asked to hand over to the most senior official in the corps. Fadah’s removal came less than seven months after he assumed office — he took over in May 2022 and became the 19th person to hold the position of NYSC DG. Announcing Uba’s appointment, Megwa had said she will act in the capacity of an “overseer”, pending the appointment of a new director-general for the corps. “Following the removal of Brigadier General Muhammad Kaku Fadah as Director General, National Youth Service Corps, by President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, Mrs Christy Uba, Director, Information and Communications Technology, the most senior director in the scheme has taken over the leadership of the corps in the capacity of overseer, pending the appointment of a substantive Director General by Mr President,” the NYSC said.
