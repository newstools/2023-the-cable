He said the police had been on the trail of the gunmen since they received the report of the abduction, adding that two suspects had been arrested. Alfred said one of the palace guards was killed during the invasion and that a police officer was shot but has been taken to the hospital for treatment “The monarch has been rescued and two suspects have been arrested. The police officer that was shot has also been rescued and thank God, he is responding to treatment,” the police spokesperson said. “We have been on the pursuit since 1 am when we received the distress call and at about 11 am, we were able to rescue them. “Efforts are being made to get some of those ones [the suspects] who ran away with bullet wounds arrested.
