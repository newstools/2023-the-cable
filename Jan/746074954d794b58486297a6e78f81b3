Abdul-Azeez Adediran, governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos, says he will convert hoodlums known as ‘area boys’ into “positive tools”. Adediran, also known as Jandor, spoke on Sunday at “The Platform debate” for governorship candidates. Speaking on how to curb the insecurity menace,  Adediran said he would work on security around parks and garages. The candidate said he would be strict with park management to ensure that they stay in line. “I have said it over and over again; I can convert them to be tools but positive ones for that matter, especially the ones we handed our motor parks to in the name of garage,” he said. “You will observe that whenever there is traffic in that corridor you will see people going to rob our people within that corridor. “So, I will say to whomever that is in charge of that garage that the day I see anybody robbing people in this corridor that is the day I am going to take the garage away from you. “You will see that they will sit up because they are making money in that garage, they wouldn’t want to lose that. That is one tool we can convert them to.” Adediran said that the state needs community policing and the trust of residents. This, he said would help the government to get information from people and be proactive. “Again, we need to do what is called intelligentsia community policing.  If we don’t do that if you rely on information to decide what is happening and you take a decision as a state security officer, get people’s trust, let them know that if they give you information, you will get it,” he said. “The moment they can reach out to you and the citizens have that confidence to reach out to you and you do the needful, you will go to preventive as against running after them when it happens. “It’s about time we buy the trust of the citizens of Lagos and say we can do this together. I’m sure we will curb insecurity from that. Information is key.”
