The ministry of youth and sports development, in partnership with the Bank of Industry, has called for entries for the second edition of the 60-day app development challenge for young tech enthusiasts across Nigeria. The initiative, which is open to applicants between ages 18 and 35, according to the national youth policy, aims at improving innovation and creativity among the Nigerian youth by encouraging them to develop their own app ideas to solve problems arising from agric-tech, edu-tech, fintech, health, sports, and telecommunications. The agric-tech sector covers technologies related to agriculture, such as precision farming, crop monitoring, and irrigation systems to help farmers optimise their crop yields, identify pests and diseases early, or streamline their irrigation systems. The edu-tech sector covers technologies related to education in online learning platforms, virtual classrooms and educational games to help students learn more effectively, provides access to high-quality education for underserved communities, or gamifies the learning process. The fintech sector covers technologies related to finance such as mobile banking, online payment systems and personal finance management tools to help people manage their finances more easily, provides access to financial services for underserved communities, or streamline the payment process for businesses. The health tech covers technologies related to healthcare such as telemedicine, fitness tracking, and disease management to help people manage their health more effectively, provide access to healthcare for underserved communities, or track and motivate healthy behaviors. The sports tech covers technologies related to sports such as fitness tracking, performance analysis and sports media to help athletes optimize their performance, provide access to sports content for underserved communities or streamline the process of managing a sports team. The telecommunications tech covers technologies related to telecommunications as mobile networks, internet service providers and communication tools to help people stay connected more easily, provide access to communication tools for underserved communities or streamline the process of managing a telecom network. In a statement on Tuesday, the ministry said it started to receive entries on Monday while the top ten created apps would attract N1 million prize each in addition to business development and training participation certificates, among others.
