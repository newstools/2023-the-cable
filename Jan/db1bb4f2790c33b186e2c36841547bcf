Sola Fasure, the media adviser to Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, says his principal did not attack Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Fasure said this in a statement on Wednesday in reaction to social media posts quoting the minister criticising the former governor of Lagos. TheCable had reported that both men had a rift in May 2020 when Aregbesola revamped the Mandate Group — a core of Tinubu’s loyalists — and usurped the closely-knitted caucus for individuals he could trust. In March 2022, associates of the duo set in a motion a move to reconcile them. While describing the social media posts as fake news, the minister’s aide said some politicians are working to frustrate efforts to reconcile the former allies. “We are observing a sinister and coordinated effort to frustrate the reconciliatory moves being championed by notable stakeholders within and beyond our party to rally all necessary factors for the success of our Party at the February 2023 Presidential Election,” the statement reads. “Just last week, jittery politicians who are authors of this malicious manuscript, paid a handful of rent-a-crowd comedians to react to a non-existent ‘attack’ and regurgitate the storyline again, with the intention to frustrate a series of reconciliation steps for their selfish interest. “We urge well-meaning Nigerians to be wary of the evil machinations of this cult of fifth columnists, whose sole business is to cause disaffection, manufacture distractions and sow discord within the APC and the progressive fold. “For the umpteenth time, the general public is advised to note that Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola is focused on delivering key reforms in the Ministry of Interior and its agencies as championed by President Muhammadu Buhari, and also ensure that the APC emerges victorious at the 2023 general election.”
