Organisers of the annual Bullet Energy Basketball tournament have increased the grand prize from N1 million to N2 million. In a statement on Wednesday, the organisers said the runner-up will get N1 million while the third place will get N500,000. The tournament, sponsored by Sam Oguche foundation, commenced as a beginners’ camp in Onitsha, Anambra state in late 2013. The 2023 edition is scheduled to hold in Asaba, Delta state in February. Unlike previous editions, the organisers said this year will only feature female participants. Speaking on the tournament, Oguche, former D’Tigers player, said the latest development was in the best interest of basketball development in Nigeria. “Initially, we didn’t plan for a competition exclusive to the women but we decided to be dynamic after assessing the situation on the ground pertaining to basketball and responding positively to it,” Oguche said. “The fact is that the men engage in a lot of competitions at home and abroad and the women’s teams are sometimes merely squeezed in for convenience. So we have decided to give the ladies a full platform to fill up to their league. Even the prize money was increased to attract the ladies.” Kwara Falcons won the men’s trophy in December while the First Bank women won their category.
