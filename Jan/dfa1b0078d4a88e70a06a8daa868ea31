The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says the Warri-Itakpe rail service has been suspended after a train derailed at kilometre 30 Ajaokuta-Itakpe section of the track. Sanni Abdulganiyu, coordinator, Warri- Itakpe train service, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday. The incident is coming two weeks after gunmen, suspected to be herdsmen, kidnapped many passengers from a train station in Edo state. But most of the abductees have been rescued, according to the state authorities. In the statement, Abdulganiyu said the train derailed at about 12:30 pm with about 148 passengers and 30 crew members on board. He, however, added that “there were no fatality nor casualties as a result of the derailment. The coordinator also said the corporation was able to immediately alert security personnel who were drafted to the accident scene. “The Warri-Itakpe train service WITS 01 derailed at kilometrem 30 Ajaokuta-Itakpe section of the track at about 12:30hrs of January 22, 2023,” the statement reads. “Thankfully, there was no fatality and no casualty. We were immediately alerted and security personnel comprising the army, police, Nigeria security and civil defence corps (NSCDC), and the community vigilante, were immediately drafted to the accident point with the assistance of the local government chairman. “All the 148 passengers and 30 crew members were evacuated to a safe place and arrangements were made to convey [the] 148 passengers to their various destinations and they have been successfully conveyed. “The cause of the derailment is not yet determined.
