Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, alongside other Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors, are in Oyo to attend the flag-off of the re-election campaign of Seyi Makinde, governor of the state. Also present are Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu, Samuel Ortom of Benue, and Okezie Ipeazu of Abia. The governors, who arrived in the state on Wednesday, are currently attending the campaign rally at Mapo Hall in Ibadan, capital of the state. Known as G5, the governors have been absent from the campaign rallies of Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate, and are demanding the resignation of Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of the party. The demand for Ayu’s resignation is on the grounds that the party’s presidential candidate and national chairman cannot be from the same region. Here are photos from the Oyo rally.
