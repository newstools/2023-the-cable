Adewole Adebayo, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) presidential candidate, says he will reduce the rate of poverty in the country and provide more opportunities for the youths if elected. Adebayo spoke on Saturday during a visit to Joseph Olubiyi Ajibise, the Ogunsua of Modakeke, in Ile Ife, Osun state. The SDP presidential candidate was represented by Yusuf Buhari, his running mate. He said one of the major problems facing the country is acute poverty in spite of the material and human resources potential. “If you go around some areas at night, you’ll see some people sleeping everywhere on the streets, no shelter,” Adebayo was quoted as saying. “If you go to the hospitals, patients are all over on the floor, no bed, only one doctor with thousands of patients. “Nigerians do not deserve this. Nigeria is a blessed country. We have resources, we have professionals, If we can put our house together, all of these things we are seeing, we’ll not be seeing them.” Adebayo said the Muhammadu Buhari administration failed to improve the welfare of ordinary citizens, adding that his party is on a mission to give Nigerians a better deal. “We are here to assure you of all the plans that we have set out, even when we get there we’re going to achieve them. We know it’s going to be difficult but we will achieve them by the grace of God,” he said. The presidential candidate said Nigerian youths have a lot to benefit from the SDP if elected into power.
