Peter Abang, a constitutional lawyer, has asked Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), to probe and prosecute those behind the attempt to frame Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), on terrorism charges. There are suggestions that the bid to arrest Emefiele might be political given the impact the redesign of the naira and limit on cash withdrawals might have on vote-buying in the 2023 elections. In December 2022, a federal high court in Abuja declined an application by the Department of State Services (DSS) to arrest the CBN governor. In a letter dated December 30 and seen by TheCable, Abang said Malami should commence his probe within seven days or he would file legal action to compel him. “In view of the above suit filed by the State Security Services, which the chief judge of the federal high court, The Hon, Justice John Tsoho delivered its ruling on 9th December 2022,” the lawyer said. “A certified copy of the Ruling is attached and we are by this letter respectfully requesting that your good offices commence a full scale criminal inquiry into the circumstances Ieading to the failed attempt by the State Security Services (otherwise known as the Department of State Services) to frame the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on allegations and trumped up terrorism financing charges as well as other sundry offences. “We also request that your offices conduct a thorough investigation and ultimately arrest and prosecute all persons and/or parties connected to the failed rogue operation in the overall interest of Nigeria. “Note that this letter serves as a notice to commence an action for mandamus to compel your offices to arrest and prosecute all persons and/or parties who are connected in the event that you fail to accede to our request within seven days from the date of service of this letter to you.”
