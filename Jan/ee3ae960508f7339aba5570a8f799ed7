Ademola Adeleke, the Osun governor, has told Gboyega Oyetola, his predecessor, to accept defeat and stop listening to the “whispering of the devil”. During a prayer session organised by the All Progressives Congress (APC) members to welcome him to the state on Monday, Oyetola had said God informed him that the election tribunal will declare him the winner of the governorship election. However, in a statement on Tuesday by Olawale Rasheed, Adeleke’s spokesperson, the governor said Oyetola should “move on”. Adeleke said his election as the governor of the state is divine, adding that God is “of justice, equity and honesty, not of electoral banditry and deceit”. “The Holy books even noted that the devil’s whispering is real and no one should mistake the voice of the devil for God. Our Almighty God has spoken resoundingly in favour of a new Governor, Senator Ademola Adeleke,” he said. “Oyetola should better be reading ‘auzubilahi mina shaytani rajeem’ so he can hear the true voice of God – that a new leader is anointed by divine will for Osun people. “Osun has launched a new chapter. This new leadership has returned state power to the people who are now feeling the new air of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Never will Osun be returned to the years of the locust.”
