Drambi Vandi, the suspended assistant superintendent of police, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Raheem Bolanle, a female lawyer. Vandi was arraigned on a one-count charge of murder before the Lagos state high court, Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) annex on Monday. After the charge sheet was read, Vandi pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. On December 25, Raheem was allegedly shot dead by Vandi at the Ajah axis of Lagos. The deceased was returning home from a Christmas outing with her family when the shooting incident occurred. The Christmas Day killing sparked widespread criticism from various sections of the country as well as the political elite. Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police (IGP), later recommended Vandi for suspension. The Police Service Commission (PSC) granted approval for the suspension on December 29. On December 30, the Lagos state government filed a one-count charge of unlawful killing against Vandi. Subsequently, the suspended police officer was remanded at the Ikoyi correctional centre. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has expressed reservations about the way the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) is handling the case.
