Kolo Toure, former Ivory Coast International, has been sacked as manager of Wigan after only nine matches in charge of the Championship club. Toure had joined Wigan to take up his first managerial job. He had replaced the sacked Leam Richardson in November. The 41-year-old was in charge for only nine matches as his team picked up only two points during his short reign at the club. Toure’s last match was a 2-0 loss at home to Luton, leading to the club terminating his appointment. “Wigan Athletic can confirm that they have parted company with First Team Manager, Kolo Touré,” the club wrote. “Touré arrived at the DW Stadium in November 2022, but after a run of results that sees the Club in a fight for survival in the Sky Bet Championship, the Board believe that this is the right time to make a change.” Reacting to the development, Malachy Brannigan, Chief Executive of Wigan Athletic, said the decision was necessary to give the club a chance to survive relegation. “Firstly, I’d like to thank Kolo, along with Kevin and Ash, for their efforts during their time at the Football Club. “Unfortunately, the results on the field have not been as we would have liked and as tough a decision as this was, the Board felt it necessary to give us the best possible chance of remaining a Championship club next season. “We know that this time of year is a key period for any football club, ourselves included. Therefore, we will now work swiftly and effectively to ensure the right person is appointed as the next permanent manager of Wigan Athletic, with the immediate objective of remaining in the Second Tier for next season.” Kolo Toure started his coaching career with Ivory Coast in August 2017 before joining Celtic’s coaching set-up a month later.
