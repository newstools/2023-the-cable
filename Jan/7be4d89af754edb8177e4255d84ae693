William Troost-Ekong, Super Eagles of Nigeria defender, on Monday, bid farewell to Watford as he inches closer to completing a move to Salernitana, the Italian Serie A side. The 29-year-old Super Eagles vice-captain is set to agree a six-month loan deal that would include the option for Salernitana to make the transfer permanent at the end of the season. Troost-Ekong took to his social media platforms to bid Watford farewell. The moment has come for me to move on from @WatfordFC after 3 special seasons shared with everyone involved. From everyone at the restaurant, security workers, volunteers at the stadium to the medical & office staff and all the rest you have made my time what it was. pic.twitter.com/hDuFquKrFO — William Troost-Ekong (@WTroostEkong) January 23, 2023  “The moment has come for me to move on from @WatfordFC after 3 special seasons shared with everyone involved,” he wrote. “From everyone at the restaurant, security workers, volunteers at the stadium to the medical & office staff and all the rest you have made my time what it was. “The coaches and most of all my teammates, I can only say thank you!!! The Pozzo family for believing in me and the important 5 years of my career at both clubs with the highlight the promotion and a chance to achieve my boyhood dream of playing in the Premier League. “To all the fans thank you for your support, it has been special going from watching as a boy to stepping on the pitch as a player. As now a fan again I wish for promotion just as much as all of you and will be back watching from the stands in the future.” Troost-Ekong joined Watford from Udinese in 2020 and led them to the English Premier League the following year. He, however, suffered relegation back to the championship after only a season. He played 64 league matches for the club.
