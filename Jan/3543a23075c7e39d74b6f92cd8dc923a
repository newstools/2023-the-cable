The Labour party has raised the alarm over the distribution of permanent voter cards (PVCs) by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Speaking with journalists on Wednesday in Enugu, Yunusa Tanko, spokesperson of the LP presidential campaign council, said the distribution of the PVCs across the country has been moving at a “snail pace”. He called on INEC to speed us the distribution process to enable Nigerians who are yet to collect their PVCs to collect them before the January 22 fixed by the electoral commission. “INEC has less than two weeks to deliver PVCs to Nigerians and the reports we are receiving nationwide about the ineptitude of its staff is disheartening and frustrating most PVC collectors,” NAN quoted Tanko as saying. “We have received reports from all the geopolitical zones in Nigeria and the messages are all the same, people complaining of the snail pace at which the PVCs are being distributed. “People go and queue for hours to collect their PVCs and out of about 500 on the line, fewer than 20 of them are able to collect theirs. “What kind of miracle is INEC going to perform that will ensure Nigerians get their PVCs within this short period if there’s no sinister motive underneath? “We have said it in different fora that on no account should any Nigerian be denied his inalienable right to cast his ballot.” The 2023 elections are less than seven weeks away. According to INEC, the presidential and national assembly elections will hold on February 25, 2023. The governorship and state house of assembly polls will take place on March 11, 2023.
