Mohammad Faizi, a spokesperson for the rescue efforts, told the BBC that the operation would continue for another three hours. “The bodies of 20 more people have been recovered and it’s feared that some bodies may still be under the rubble.” According to the report, ambulances were seen racing in and out of the compound every few minutes.

Muhammad Khan, a police official, had said between 300 to 400 police personnel were present in the area at the time of the blast. Pakistan’s President Arif Alvi condemned the attack, saying measures would be put in place to take out terrorism from the roots in the country. “There is a need to take joint and far-reaching measures to eradicate terrorism from its roots. Schools of thought must work together to eliminate the ideological base of terrorists,” the president said. “Islam does not allow brutal killings and suicide attacks of citizens. Such acts of terrorism are against the teachings of Islam. Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured in the attack.”
