Arsenal scored a last-minute winner to earn a 3-2 win over in-form Manchester United in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday evening. Arsenal, the league leaders, were made to sweat in the exhilarating encounter that saw Edie Nketiah score twice, including the winner, in a feisty and pacy encounter. Bukayo Saka also scored for Arsenal while Marcus Rashford and Lisandro Martinez were the visitors’ goalscorers. The win maintained Arsenal’s five-point lead at the summit of the EPL table with 50 points from 19 matches. Man United remain third with 39 points from 20 games, 11 points adrift of the leaders. Earlier in the day, Manchester City defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0, thanks to a hat-trick from Erling Haaland at the Etihad stadium. Haaland scored a header to give City the lead, dispatched a penalty to double it, and swept home a third from Mahrez’s pass to seal the victory. The 22-year-old Norwegian striker has scored 25 EPL goals from 20 matches.
