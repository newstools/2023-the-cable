A federal high court in Abuja has fixed April 5 to deliver judgment in the suit against Stephen Oronsaye, former head of service of the federation. Inyang Ekwo, the presiding judge, fixed the date shortly after parties in the case adopted their final written addresses for and against the case. Oronsaye was arraigned alongside Osarenkhoe Afe, managing director of Fedrick Hamilton Global Services Limited, on a 49-count charge. The charges were, however, reduced to 22. Three companies â€” Cluster Logistic Limited, Kangolo Dynamic Cleaning Limited, and Drew Investment & Construction Company Limited were also joined in the charge preferred against Oronsaye by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC alleged that the defendants had, between 2010 and 2011, used the firms to divert public funds through procurement fraud. Adopting his final address at the court session on Thursday, Oransanye, through his counsel, Ade Okeanya-inneh, asked the court to dismiss the charge against him. He submitted that the EFCC has failed to show sufficient evidence to support its case. However, the EFCC, represented by Oluwaleke Atolagbe, requested that the defendants be found guilty based on the testimony of 21 witnesses who testified in the case.
