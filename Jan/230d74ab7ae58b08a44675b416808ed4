Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers, says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has no hand in the alleged explosion that occurred at the rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. On Thursday, Darlington Nwauju, Rivers APC spokesperson, said there was an explosion during the party’s governorship rally at Ojukwu field, Rumuwoji community in Port Harcourt, the state capital. He said some elements of the explosive device were removed from the body of one of the injured persons. Meanwhile, Grace Iringe-Koko, Rivers police spokesperson, countered Nwauju, saying no explosion occurred — and that the incident was a clash between the community members and party supporters. The APC had also accused the PDP of having a hand in the incident. Reacting to the development on Friday at a PDP campaign rally in Oyigbo LGA, Wike dismissed the APC’s allegation. “They went to Etche tipper park, one place, and held a rally. Did anybody stop them? They went to the Ikwerre local government and held their rally. Did anybody stop them?” he asked. “Why will it now be our business when they go to Rumuwoji playground — a small playground — to go and do rally? They went and paid money when they knew the community was small. They now said it is PDP. “We didn’t do anything when you went to Etche; we didn’t do anything when you went to Ikwerre, which is in Port Harcourt. Does it make sense? “If you know you are not prepared for the election, go home and rest. We are prepared for the election, and we know we are going to win this election.”
