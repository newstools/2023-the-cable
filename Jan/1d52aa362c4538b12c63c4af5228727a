Arsenal’s winning run in the English Premier League (EPL) was halted at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night following a goalless draw against Newcastle United. The Gunners, who are the current EPL table leaders, found the high-flying Toons who have lost only once this season a tough nut to crack as the resilient visitors held on to the end. Chances were few and in-between but Eddie Nketiah saw his low shot saved by Nick Pope, Newcastle goalkeeper, while Joellinton failed to convert a back post header from a corner. The draw snapped Arsenal’s six-match winning run but the Gunners, with 44 points, extended their lead at the top to eight points. Newcastle, however, have 35 points and share the third place with Manchester United who defeated Bournemouth 3-0 at Old Trafford. Goals from Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford earned Erik ten Hag’s side a fourth consecutive league win. RESULTS
