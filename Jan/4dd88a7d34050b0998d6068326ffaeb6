Umar Ibrahim, national secretary of the Labour Party (LP), says Isaac Auta, deputy speaker of the Kaduna house of assembly, has joined the party. Ibrahim said Auta, who represents Kauru constituency, alongside Suleiman Dabo, lawmaker representing Zaria constituency, joined the party from the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ibrahim spoke on Thursday while inaugurating the party’s governorship campaign council in Kaduna. Ibrahim, who is also the chairman of the LP governing council, said half of the members in the Kaduna state house of assembly are supporters of Peter Obi, the LP presidential candidate. “Sincerely speaking, today is one of the happiest moments in my life. I have gone around to campaign for our presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and I have received great receptions,” he said. “I am particularly impressed by the calibre of personalities that graced this inauguration. In the entire northern states, we don’t have any personality that dumped APC and joined Labour Party, except in Kaduna state (where) the deputy speaker and another member from Zaria state constituency (joined LP).” Also speaking, Jonathan Asake, the LP governorship candidate in Kaduna, described the party’s campaign movement as “divine” “This is a call to service because the mood in the nation is that the Labour Party must take over the nation,” he said. “The mood of the nation is nothing other than the readiness of the youths to take over Kaduna and Nigeria, so that the country will be a production nation and not a consuming nation. “This is a divine movement and God’s hand is in the movement. May peace come to Nigeria so that we may not experience hunger or kidnapping again.”
