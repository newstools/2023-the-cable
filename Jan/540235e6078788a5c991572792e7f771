The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council says Atiku Abubakar, its flag bearer, is hale and hearty. Dino Melaye, spokesperson of the PDP presidential campaign council, said the former vice-president travelled to the United Kingdom at the invitation of the British government. There have been reports that the PDP presidential candidate is sick and was flown to the UK for treatment. In a social media post, on Sunday, Melaye described the reports as “lies of unrepentant liars”. “Disregard the lies of unrepentant liars. Atiku is 100% fit and in super form health-wise,” he wrote. “The British government invited the leading presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, just like they had invited Bola Tinubu and Peter Obi earlier. “Nigerians should henceforth disregard drug-induced statements propelled by some online medium.” In a separate post on Twitter, Paul Ibe, Atiku’s media adviser, said the meeting is expected to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday. “For the avoidance of doubt H.E Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the PDP and former VP of Nigeria, 1999-2007, will be arriving in London on Monday, January 9, for meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday on the invitation of the British Government,” the tweet reads. For the avoidance of doubt H.E @atiku, Presidential candidate of the @OfficialPDPNig and former VP of Nigeria, 1999-2007 will be arriving London on Monday, 9th of January for meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday on the invitation of the British Government.https://t.co/KmJdeAptGH https://t.co/p65ALgTkLa — Paul Ibe (@omonlakiki) January 8, 2023  Earlier on Sunday, Atiku condemned the train station attack in Edo, saying Nigeria urgently needs state police.
