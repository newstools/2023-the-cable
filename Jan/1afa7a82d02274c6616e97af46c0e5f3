Gboyega Oyetola, the former governor of Osun state, says the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is the greatest beneficiary of the tribunal ruling which restored his mandate. The tribunal on Friday sacked Ademola Adeleke, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the governorship poll held on July 16, 2022. In August 2022, Oyetola and the All Progressives Congress (APC) petitioned the tribunal to challenge the victory of Adeleke in the election. Among several issues, Oyetola contended that there was overvoting in 749 polling units across 10 LGAs of the state. Delivering judgment, two out of the three-member panel of the tribunal held that the petitioner was able to prove that there was indeed over-voting in some of the polling units. Consequently, the majority judgment of the tribunal ordered INEC to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Adeleke and issue a fresh one to Oyetola as the duly elected governor of Osun. ‘NO VICTOR, NO VANQUISHED’ Speaking with journalists in his country home in the Iragbiji area of Osun, Oyetola said there was no victor, no vanquished. “There is no victor, no vanquished. It is a collective victory for our state and our nation’s democracy,” he said. “I am happy that the judgment had resolved the controversy of July 16th 2022 governorship election. “INEC is the greatest beneficiary of the judgment. It will afford them the opportunity to look at all the anomalies and make necessary adjustments to prevent such mistakes now that the general elections are coming. “I thank the people of the state and supporters for standing by us, for their courage and loyalty. I want to assure them that we are ready to continue to serve them.” Adeleke has vowed to appeal the judgment, describing it as a miscarriage of justice.
