Some officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) are feared to have been killed following an ambush in Birnin Gwari LGA of Kaduna. The development, according to sources, occurred on Monday. The officers were said to be ambushed while they were escorting an expatriate to a mining site in Birnin Gwari area of the state. “Eight personnel were assigned to provide security cover to the expatriate to a mining area, when they were ambushed by a large number of bandits,” the source said. “Seven of them were killed on the spot while one person was critically injured. “Both the injured and the corpses of those killed were brought to Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, Kaduna. “I don’t have any information about the expatriate. The bandits were many so our men were overwhelmed.” When contacted, Habeeb Badamasi, NSCDC spokesperson in Kaduna, said the command will provide details on the development in time. Badamasi, however, did not confirm if there were casualties. “We have nothing to report for now. We will give you details tomorrow once it is ready,” Badamasi said. Meanwhile, Abubakar Kakangi, a resident of the area, said gunmen attacked two communities in Birnin Gwari and killed some NSCDC officers, soldiers, police operatives, and vigilantes. Kakangi said the attack took place at a checkpoint on Sunday. He added that the gunmen attacked Kubau and Unguwan Zakara village, adding the attackers had earlier entered into an agreement with the residents on “authorised” farming areas.
