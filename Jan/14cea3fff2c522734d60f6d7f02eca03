Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says if he is elected, his administration will “build a country everyone will be proud of”. Speaking on Wednesday in Kaduna at the flag-off of his campaign in the north-west, Obi said he will unite and secure Nigeria if he is elected. The LP  candidate also blamed insecurity in the country on bad leadership. “The security situation is not because bandits and other criminal elements are more formidable than the government, but because of bad leadership. That is why the bandits are everywhere and operating almost freely, killing and causing unimaginable destruction of valuables,” Obi said. “We will restructure the security architecture. Security personnel will be well taken care of. We will ensure their lives are taken care of so that their families are taken care of in the event of death. “Datti and I will change this country from consumption to production country, because of the high prices of things. All the vast lands in the north will be centres of agriculture. Kaduna state again will become a processing centre. “The Bank of Agriculture will finance food production in Nigeria and all the support groups — youth, women and all Nigerians — their labour for the party will not go in vain. “We are about to bring back that Nigeria where everybody was happy to belong. Kaduna state represented productivity in the north. It represented what was good in Nigeria. And that is what we want to bring back. We are tired of hearing stories. “Kaduna state hosts the best military formations in the country. It is supposed to be more secure than any part of the country, But there are so many security challenges in the state. “We will secure and unite Nigeria. Security will come back again.”
