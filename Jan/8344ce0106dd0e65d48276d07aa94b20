Not less than 18 persons were burnt beyond recognition on Wednesday in an auto crash in Narbodo village, Toro LGA of Bauchi state. Yusuf Abdullahi, the sector commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), shared details of the incident in a road traffic report made available to NAN on Thursday. Abdullahi said the accident involved one Toyota Hiace bus and an articulated vehicle, revealing that three people in the trailer were unscathed. He said the accident occurred around 4:40 pm, noting that the personnel of the corps arrived at the scene within seven minutes of the crash. He attributed the cause of the crash to a speeding violation which led to a head-on collision between the two vehicles. “Twenty-one people were involved in the road crash and there were 18 male adults and three children,” he said. “Eighteen people who were all inside the Toyota Hiace bus were burnt beyond recognition as the vehicle went up in flames after having a head-on collision with the trailer.” Abdullahi said a mass burial was immediately carried out for the victims by the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). The sector commander advised motorists to always be conscious of traffic rules and regulations while plying the roads.
