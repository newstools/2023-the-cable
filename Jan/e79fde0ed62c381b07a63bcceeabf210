Rabiu Kwankwaso, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), says he is certain he will win at the first ballot. There have been speculations of a run-off election over the possibility of an outcome where no candidate “secures the highest number of votes cast; and not less than a quarter of the votes cast in each of at least two-thirds of all the states and the federal capital territory (FCT)” at the first ballot. This is according to section 134 of the constitution. Speaking on Wednesday at Chatham House in the United Kingdom, Kwankwaso said he is confident that his party will win the election “fair and square” and there won’t be a need for a run-off. “We are aware that some anti-democratic forces are scheming to hide behind the possibility of a second ballot in the presidential election as speculated by INEC to derail our democracy,” he said. “Let it be known that no contraption in whatever guise other than an elected government will be acceptable to Nigerians in 2023. “We in the NNPP believe that we will win the election fair and square at the first ballot. We appeal to the president not to listen to any proposal that seeks to undermine the 2023 general elections. “We also call on well-meaning Nigerians as well as the international community to be vigilant.” In his address at the Chatham House on Tuesday, Mahmood Yakubu, the chairperson of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), said the commission is prepared for a run-off if necessary. “We prepare for that possibility because until the constitution was amended, there was only one week for a presidential run-off in case it happens,” Yakubu had said. “With the number of voters we have, it is almost impossible to print the ballot papers and result sheets required, deliver them to the locations, and conduct the elections as required.”
