Arsenal scored two first half goals to consign rivals Tottenham to a 2-0 defeat in the North London derby on Sunday. A Hugo Lloris own goal and Martin Odegaard strike were enough for Arsenal to retain bragging rights as they continue their charge for a possible English Premier League title win. The Gunners took the lead just before the 15th minute when Bukayo Saka’s shot from an impossible angle was deflected into the net by Lloris. A relentless Arsenal hit the woodwork through Thomas Partey and then doubled their advantage through Odegaard’s 30-yard strike that found the bottom corner. Tottenham improved in the second period but were denied a goal, courtesy of good saves from Aaron Ramsdale as Arsenal ended their hosts’ run of eight North London derbies at home without defeat. The win takes Arsenal to 47 points from 18 matches, eight points ahead of second-placed Manchester City while Tottenham remain fifth with 33 points. In an earlier encounter, Chelsea overcame Crystal Palace 1-0 thanks to Kai Havertz’s goal while Newcastle survived conceding a penalty to beat Fulham 1-0. Alexander Isak scored the late strike to help the Magpies remain third on the log. RESULTS Newcastle United 1-0 Fulham
