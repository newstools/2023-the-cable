Martina Navratilova, the Czech-American tennis legend, has been diagnosed with both throat and breast cancer. Navratilova spoke about her battle with throat and breast cancer in a chat with Tennis.com on Monday. The 18-time Grand Slam singles champion said she noticed an enlarged lymph node in her neck during November’s WTA finals in Fort Worth, Texas. The 66-year-old, who was previously diagnosed with a noninvasive form of breast cancer in 2010, also said she discovered a resurgence of the tumour. In a statement released on Monday, the tennis legend said she will start treatment later this month. “Martina Navratilova has been diagnosed with stage one throat cancer. The prognosis is good and Martina will start her treatment this month,” the statement reads. “The cancer type is HPV and this particular type responds really well to treatment. Martina noticed an enlarged lymph node in her neck during the WTA finals in Fort Worth. When it didn’t go down, a biopsy was performed, the results came back as stage one throat cancer. “At the same time as Martina was undergoing the tests for the throat, a suspicious form was found in her breast, which was subsequently diagnosed as cancer, completely unrelated to the throat cancer. “Both these cancers are in their early stages with great outcomes. Martina won’t be covering the Australian Open for Tennis Channel from their studio but hopes to be able to join in from time to time by Zoom.” Navratilova won 59 Grand Slam titles — including 18 singles titles and 41 doubles and mixed doubles trophies —  during her career that spanned from 1973 to 2006. She has the most Grand Slam wins in the Open Era. The Czech-American also became the record winner of the Wimbledon singles championships. She won on the grass nine times.
