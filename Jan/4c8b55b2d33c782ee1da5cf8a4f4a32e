According to NAN, Abdullahi Haruna-Kiyawa, the police spokesperson, in a statement on Wednesday, said the command discovered the couple after they got reports that they had not been seen since January 2. He said an investigation revealed that the couple died of suffocation, adding that the death was linked to a charcoal fire they had lit to warm their room from cold. “We received a report on January 3, at about 9:00 pm from Kwa Village in Dawakin Tofa LGA that a couple was discovered not to have come out of its matrimonial home since it was last seen on January 2 at about 11:00 p.m,” he said. “When the grandmother of Idris forced the door open, she discovered the couple motionless on the matrimonial bed, with smoke odour pervading the room. “On receipt of the report, the Kano State Commissioner of Police, Mr Mamman Dauda, directed a team of detectives led by CSP Ahmed Hamza, DPO Dawakin Tofa Division to proceed to the scene. “The bodies of the victims were removed from the scene and rushed to Murtala Muhammed Specialist Hospital, Kano, where a medical doctor confirmed them dead. “They locked up and got suffocated by the smoke that emanated from the burning charcoal burning while fast asleep.” Haruna-Kiyawa who said investigations were still ongoing, advised residents of the state to be careful while using charcoal fire and avoid the risk of fire outbreak in the harmattan period.
