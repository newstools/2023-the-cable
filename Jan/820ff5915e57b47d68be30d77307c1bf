Festus Keyamo says he is ready to forfeit his role as the spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council, in order to take up a case against Atiku Abubakar. TheCable earlier reported that the APC presidential campaign council asked law enforcement agencies to arrest Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate, based on an audio recording released by Michael Achimugu, a former aide to Abubakar. In the audio, the former vice president is alleged to have explained how shell organisations were set up to divert public funds. TheCable is yet to verify the authenticity of the recording. Speaking on Tuesday in an interview on a Channels Television, Keyamo presented three documents, including two appointment letters and an email correspondence he said linked Achimugu to Abubakar. Keyamo also said he is committed to going to any legal length to see that the PDP candidate is charged to court over alleged money laundering. “In the case when they challenged my principal, when they brought up dirty documents from the US, remember, I said they should come out with their full chests and go to court. Up till today, they ran away,” he said. “I’m going to court. And so, if they wish this away, it will not go away. I’m doing this under three capacities — first of all, I’m a member of the inner bar who has sworn to defend and uphold our laws. Secondly, I’m an ordinary concerned Nigerian who has the right to bring perpetrators of crime to book. Thirdly, before I was appointed minister, I was an active prosecutor for the EFCC for more than 15 years. “So, I have the duty to help them to  follow up on whistleblowers. “I am proceeding to court. If Asiwaju says I’m diverting from his campaign, ‘don’t campaign for me again’, I’ll say please take your campaign because this is national interest. I have taken it personally.”
