The Church of England bishops have insisted on not allowing same-sex marriage in the churches. In a press statement, the bishops said same-sex couples would be able to come to church to give thanks for their civil marriage or partnership and receive God’s blessing. They said the church would not change its formal teaching that holy matrimony is between one man and one woman. “Drawing from the feedback received through Living in Love and Faith, the bishops also identify a number of key areas for further reflection and work,” the statement reads. It added that the bishops would issue an apology to the LGBTQI+ persons for the “rejection, exclusion, and hostility” they have faced in churches. “Under the proposals, same-sex couples would still not be able to get married in a Church of England but could have a service in which there would be prayers of dedication, thanksgiving or for God’s blessing on the couple in church following a civil marriage or partnership. “The formal teaching of the Church of England as set out in the canons and authorised liturgies – that Holy Matrimony is between one man and one woman for life – would not change. “The prayers would be voluntary for clergy to use and could be used in different combinations reflecting the theological diversity of the Church. “The proposals for the Church of England follow a discussion at the Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops from around the world last year on topics including same-sex marriage and blessings. “And they will urge all congregations in their care to welcome same-sex couples ‘ unreservedly and joyfully’ as they reaffirm their commitment to a radical new Christian inclusion founded in scripture, in reason, in tradition, in theology and the Christian faith as the Church of England has received it – based on good, healthy, flourishing relationships, and in a proper 21st Century understanding of being human and of being sexual.”
