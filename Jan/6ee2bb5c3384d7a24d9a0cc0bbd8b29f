Victor Osimhen scored the opener as Napoli defeated Sampdoria 2-0 in their Serie A clash at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. The Partenopeans overcame the disappointing 1-0 loss to Inter Milan last weekend to register an emphatic victory over Sampdoria on Sunday. Osimhen put them ahead in the 19th minute after a brilliant read of the run-of-play saw him sprinting into the box to connect with Mario Rui’s perfectly timed pass. It was a routine finish but an important one that increased his tally of league goals to 10 and extended his lead on the goal scorer chart. The Serie A leaders secured the win in the 82nd minute after Elis Elmas converted from the spot to send Napoli seven points clear at the league’s summit. In England, Everton confirmed that Alex Iwobi will be out for three weeks after suffering an ankle injury. The Nigerian international midfielder was injured in the Toffees’ 3-1 defeat to Manchester United in the FA Cup third-round tie at Old Trafford on Friday night. Iwobi’s injury happened two minutes into the second half when he latched on to a poor Casemiro pass to burst forward, but the former Arsenal midfielder was brought down by Tyrell Malacia. He should be back before the Super Eagles resume their AFCON qualification campaign against Guinea Bissau in March. In another FA Cup game, Kelechi Iheanacho scored the winning goal for Leicester City to defeat a stubborn Gillingham side. Iheanacho’s goal came in the 56th minute after steering Kasey McAteer’s well-placed cross beyond Jake Turner in the hosts’ goal.
