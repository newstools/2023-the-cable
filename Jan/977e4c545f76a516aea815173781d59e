Kashim Shettima, the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), visited Ayodele Fayose, former governor of Ekiti state, in his residence on Tuesday. Fayose, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is sympathetic to the cause of the G5 governors of the opposition party. The G5 governors, led by Nyesom Wike of Rivers, are demanding the resignation of Iyorchia Ayu as the national chairman of the party. Shettima shared pictures of his visit to Fayose on his Twitter page while thanking him for his support. See the photos below. I paid my brother, former Governor of Ekiti State, H.E. Ayodele Peter Fayose a visit. The great Oshko welcomed us with warmth and rare camaraderie. Thank you for your support and God bless you for hosting me and my team. pic.twitter.com/gFFLAO8zV9 â€” Kashim Shettima (@KashimSM) January 24, 2023  Below are pictures.
