Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says the forthcoming election is about the character of a candidate and not the tribe. Speaking on Saturday at the town hall meeting to solicit the support of Ondo indigenes, the former Anambra state governor said if elected as president, Nigerians would be proud of their country. He explained that he and his running mate, Ahmed Datti, are people with a traceable background. Obi said although he is tagged as a stingy person, he is not corrupt. “They said that I’m stingy, we want stingy people now so that we can keep the money. We want to make sure we use your money to transform the country,” he said. “Don’t vote for tribe, if they say it is their turn, tell them it is your turn to take back the country. We are ready to save the country. “This election is about character. You know our background, the school we went to, we don’t know their age. “We want to change Nigeria for the better. We want to move Nigeria from consumption to production. “We don’t want people to run out of Nigeria again. We want to restructure Nigeria for development. We want to build a better Nigeria, so go out and support us. “We want to fight corruption. We will make sure that we have electricity. The whole south of Ondo state has not seen electricity for several years, how can there be development? “Pick your PVCs and vote for Labour Party and make sure that they count the vote.”
