AT3, a Lagos-based communication and events consultancy firm, is set to celebrate its fifth anniversary. To mark the milestone, the firm, which provides strategic public relations and media interventions to individuals and corporate organisations, will host a week-long digital marketing boot camp. In a statement issued on Saturday, Tosin Adefeko, chief executive officer of the firm, said the boot camp, themed ‘Leveraging Possibilities for SMEs in The digital age’, aims to empower business owners in Nigeria. Adefeko said the participants would be armed with the best digital marketing tools, tips, trends, tactics and strategies from industry experts, adding that they will have the opportunity of learning from 10 astute business leaders. “In the course of our journey, we frequently encounter small and medium businesses who desire communications interventions but do not have the requisite knowledge or resources to support their growth,” she said. “In commemoration of our milestone 5th anniversary, we decided to lend our support to the growth of small businesses in tune with our belief that SMEs are the lifeblood of our economy. “The digital marketing boot camp will enable SMEs to take advantage of growth prospects in the digital media era. The boot camp will include a deep dive into areas like online reputation management, communications strategy, digital marketing, brand & visuals, and the ‘Always on’ Entrepreneur.” The boot camp will be facilitated by digital marketing and communications experts such as Nkiru Olumide-Ojo, founder of the Lighthouse network; Frankline Ozekhome, pop culture strategist; Rufai Oseni, global speaker & development expert; Ugochukwu Obi-Chukwu, founder of Nairametrics; and Oluwasola Obagbemi, corporate communications manager, Anglophone West Africa, Meta, among many others.
