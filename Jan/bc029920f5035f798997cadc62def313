Residents of Ndi-Imoko Arondizogu in Ideato-north LGA, Imo state have deserted their homes over threats by unknown gunmen to invade the community. The gunmen were said to have threatened to invade the area on Monday night. A villager who pleaded anonymity told TheCable that inhabitants of the community flee their homes after receipt of intelligence that gunmen would take over the village. “We have on good authority that there is a planned invasion of our community on Monday night by unknown gunmen. As I speak, my village is deserted for fear of the unknown,” the resident said. “Arondizogu has become a war zone for the past three months. The last was the killing of the LGA chairman today by gunmen after holding him captive for five days. “I call on the Commissioner of Police and the government of Imo state to come to our rescue because my people dying one by one.” TheCable reported that Chris Ohizu, sole administrator of Ideato-North LGA was killed on Monday after spending days in the kidnappers’ den.
