Babajide Sanwo-Olu says the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) is the best tertiary medical facility in the country. The governor of Lagos said this in an interview on TVC on Monday while speaking on his achievements in the health sector. Sanwo-Olu said his administration has been able to satisfy the needs of health workers in Lagos state. He said contrary to what happened in other states, resident doctors had no reason to go on strike in Lagos. “We are the only one that has kept our doctors all the while when resident doctors were on strike. Not one day were we on strike,” he said. “It’s because we were able to sit with them. I have the best residency care centre in LASUTH. I have rooms for not just house officers but residency. “We are building doctors’ quarters in Gbagada. We are building doctors’ quarters in LASUTH. We are ensuring they can indeed feel good. “We are the highest employer in the medical field in the entire country. LASUTH today is the best tertiary health facility that we have in the country. “For critical care, we are not joking about it. These are very extensive things we need to continue to keep up with.”
