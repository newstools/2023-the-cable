Ibraheem Abdullateef, the special assistant to AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, governor of Kwara, says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is not an option for the people of the state. Abdullateef said this on Saturday after leading members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to a rally to campaign for his principal and Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the APC, in Ilorin, the capital city of Kwara. While addressing members of the party during the rally, the governor’s aide said the people have tried the PDP but the party failed them. He said progress has been recorded across the various sectors of the state in the last three years. “We have tried, trusted and tested them (PDP) and they failed woefully. We have nothing to show for it here,” he said. “They should never be an option again. We have all seen the changes recorded by the governor in education, health, infrastructure, women and youth development in the last three years. “Our collective resolve is to support him to continue the good work. I believe strongly that we know where we were and what we have gotten in this community now. “We will even get more. All we have to do is to vote for Tinubu, AbdulRazaq and all APC candidates. To go forward, we have to elect credible leaders.” On his part, Ibrahim Akaje, Kwara commissioner for business and innovation technology, urged the people to ensure that they work for the victory of APC in the state.
