A federal capital territory (FCT) high court in Garki has dismissed allegations of false asset declaration against Mahmood Yakubu, chairperson of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The court also barred the Department of State Services (DSS), the police, and Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) from investigating Yakubu over his asset declaration. One Somadina Uzoamaka had filed a suit marked FCT/HC/GAR/CV/47/2022, against the attorney-general of the federation (AGF) and Yakubu, seeking among other things, an order of mandatory injunction directing and compelling the INEC chairman to step down pending the investigation and consideration of the various allegations against him by the various law enforcement agencies. The plaintiff also prayed the court to issue a 10-year ban on the INEC chairperson, excluding him from holding or assuming any public office, and alleged that Mahmood purchased properties with illicit funds. Responding to the allegations, the INEC chairperson had tendered exhibits before the court showing the source of the money with which he purchased various properties. Delivering judgment on Wednesday, Maryam Hassan, the presiding judge, held that the INEC chairman complied with the relevant requirements in declaring his assets. The judge further held that having complied with the relevant laws in his asset declaration, Yakubu could not be investigated by any of the nation’s security agencies, as requested by the claimant. The court declined to grant any of the 14 reliefs sought by the claimant, adding that the INEC chairperson cannot be removed over “fabricated” allegations of false asset declaration.
