Ikechi Emenike, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia state, and his wife, Uzoma, met with President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday. Uzoma is Nigeria’s ambassador to the United States. The meeting with Buhari held at the state house in Abuja. Also, on Thursday, Emenike visited Ndume ward in Umuahia north LGA in Abia state. Speaking with residents, the APC candidate asked them to reject candidates and political parties that have mismanaged the state. “Don’t joke with your right to vote. Don’t sell your votes,” he said. He added that his movement — rescue and develop Abia (RADA) —  has gained momentum and is ready to remove the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the seat of power. Emenike said Abia has been mismanaged over the years and urged people of the state to use the 2023 poll to “free Abia from bad leaders”. “It is an offence against God to owe workers, yet somebody would not pay workers and pensioners and still go to bed and sleep happily, displaying their callousness,” he said. Nwanne Nwabuisi, a federal commissioner of the National Population Commission (NPC), who hosted the governorship candidate, assured him of victory in his ward. The coast is now clear for us to plan, strategise and march with confidence towards winning the Abia state governorship race in the forthcoming election,” Nwabuisi said.
