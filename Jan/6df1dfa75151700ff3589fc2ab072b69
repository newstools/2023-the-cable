The Institute for African Women in Law (IAWL) has launched three reports on issues affecting female legal professionals in Nigeria. In a statement on Thursday, Jarpa Dawunu, executive director of IAWL, said the reports were launched in partnership with the Nigerian Bar Association Women Forum (NBAWF). The reports, focusing on areas of law and leadership were launched in Lagos on January 18. Dawunu said the reports documented the roles of women in tackling issues of gender-based discrimination in the justice system. She added that highlights of the reports included ways in which women in the legal profession could use the law to influence positive changes and development in the justice system. While commenting on the report, Chinyere Okorocha, chairperson of the NBAWF, said the reports were rich sources of data on the challenges of female leaders in the profession. “The NBAWF is proud to have collaborated with the IAWL on this laudable report. It is a rich data source on the issues affecting women leaders in the sector, and we look forward to partnering with stakeholders to implement the recommended solutions,” Okorocha said. She commended Oluyemi Bamgbose, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), for pioneering the collaboration and also appreciated Adejoke Oyewunmi, head of the NBAWF research and documentation committee, for leading the team. The NBAWF is an arm of the Nigerian Bar Association committed to empowering, inspiring, and supporting female legal professionals in Nigeria. The Institute for African Women in Law (IAWL) is a pan-African non-profit, non-governmental organisation committed to supporting the formidable works of women in law across Africa and the diaspora. Meanwhile, judges of superior courts of records, key actors in the justice system, top law firms, leading academics, and philanthropic organizations were said to be present at the launching of the reports.
