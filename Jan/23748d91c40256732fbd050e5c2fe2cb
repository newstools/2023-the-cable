The national working committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suspended Tochukwu Okorie, the party’s chairperson in Ebonyi, over alleged anti-party activities. Debo Ologunagba, the PDP spokesperson, announced the development in a statement issued on Friday. Ologunagba said Okoroafor was suspended on Friday after the PDP “extensively” reviewed his affairs in the party. He added that Okoroafor has been referred to the party’s “appropriate disciplinary committee for further action”. “The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), at its emergency meeting held on January 27, 2023, extensively reviewed the conduct and activities of the Ebonyi State Chairman of our Party, Okorie Tochukwu Okoroafor,” the statement reads. “Pursuant to Sections 29 (2) (b) and 57(3) of the Constitution of the PDP (as amended in 2017) the NWC has on behalf of the National Executive Committee (NEC) approved the suspension of Okorie Tochukwu Okoroafor with effect from today, Friday, January 27, 2023, over allegations of anti-party activities and violation of provisions of Section 58 (1) of the PDP Constitution (as amended in 2017).” Meanwhile, the development comes months after the Ebonyi state working committee (SWC) of the party suspended Okorie over alleged gross misconduct. In a separate statement, the PDP said it will hold its presidential campaign rally in Kebbi state on Saturday. According to the statement by Umar Bature, director of field operations, the rally will be held at Filin Su Kuwa, Birnin Kebbi. “Please endeavour to mobilise your supporters massively to participate as we join hands with our Presidential Candidate, H.E. Atiku Abubakar, GCON (Waziri Adamawa), to Rescue Nigeria,” he added.
