Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto, says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has “workable strategies” to end banditry and unemployment. Tambuwal, who is the director-general of the PDP presidential campaign council, spoke on Monday when he received some new members into the party in Sokoto. The defectors included Zayyanu Wamakko, the nephew of Aliyu Wamakko, former governor of Sokoto and leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Tambuwal said the PDP administration will “boost the socio-economic life of Nigerians” if it wins the presidential election scheduled to take place on February 25. Tambuwal, who described the PDP as the “best choice” for Nigerians, asked party members to come out en masse on election day to vote for the party. “I want to advise our teeming youths to keep their permanent voter cards (PVCs) safe and engage in house to house campaigns for more support to guarantee the victory of PDP at all levels,” he said. “A PDP government, if elected, has designed workable strategies to end banditry, fight corruption, unemployment, address infrastructural decay and boost the socio-economic life of Nigerians among other issues.”
