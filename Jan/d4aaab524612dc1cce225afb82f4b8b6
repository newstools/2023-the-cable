The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced Sultan al-Jaber, the head of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), as the president of COP28 climate conference this year. COP28, the 28th edition of the United Nations climate change conference, is set to be held in UAE from November 30 to December 12, 2023. Usually, a COP president is chosen each year from the host country and is expected to set the conference agenda, drive ambition internationally, lead the formal negotiations and have oversight of the overall COP package and vision, including political declarations. In a statement from his office, Jaber, who is also UAEâ€™s climate envoy and minister of industry and technology, said his presidency will play a central role in intergovernmental negotiations to build consensus. The UAE will be the second Arab country to host the climate conference after Egypt hosted COP27 in 2022. In his welcome address, Sameh Shoukry, COP27 president, reaffirmed his support for the UAE adding that he looks forwards to working closely with Al Jaber. Meanwhile, the COP28 president will be the first serving oil executive to assume the role of COP president. The BBC reports that campaigners say Al Jaber must stand down from his oil business role as president because it is a clear conflict of interest. They are of the view that someone steeped in the oil industry may not push countries to rapidly reduce their fossil fuel use which scientists say is critical to avoiding dangerous climate change.
