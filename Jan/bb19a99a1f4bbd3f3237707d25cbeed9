President Muhammadu Buhari has asked residents of Yobe state to vote for Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to continue his legacy. Buhari spoke on Tuesday at the township stadium in Damaturu, venue of the party’s presidential campaign rally in Yobe. The president said the former governor of Lagos is capable of continuing his legacy. “I accompany Asiwaju here to tell you to vote for him so that he can continue with my legacy of rebuilding Nigeria,” the president said. On his part, Tinubu said the Yobe cargo airport inaugurated by the president on Monday would be needed to accomplish his plans to boost the country’s agricultural sector. “The cargo airport Mr President commissioned yesterday will be greatly needed when our agenda for greater production of agricultural and industrial exports begins to take off,” he said. “It is a wise investment made with courage and foresight. It will be needed to transport Yobe’s excellent sesame, hibiscus, and gum Arabic to the rest of the world.” The former governor of Lagos praised the president for the success in the fight against insecurity. Abdullahi Adamu, national chairperson of the APC; Senate President Ahmad Lawan, and Kashim Shettima, Tinubu’s running mate, were among some of the dignitaries present at the rally.
