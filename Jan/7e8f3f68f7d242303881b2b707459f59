The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has suspended the Abuja-Kaduna rail services after a train derailed on the corridor. A train said to be a few minutes from its destination in Abuja derailed on Friday afternoon. The incident was said to have occurred in the Kubwa area of the federal capital territory (FCT). In an update seen by TheCable, the NRC said it suspended services on the route, due to ‘unforeseen circumstances’. “Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Abuja-Kaduna train services has been suspended,” the corporation said in an update on its mobile application. The development comes a few days after the Warri-Itakpe train service derailed at kilometre 30 Ajaokuta-Itakpe section of the track. Yakubu Mahmood, NRC spokesperson, was not immediately available when TheCable reached out for enquiries. Meanwhile, the Abuja-Kaduna train service has been experiencing some difficulties in it operations recently. Three days ago, passengers experienced delays on the route, but the corporation blamed it on the poor quality of diesel it received. “The delay was caused by the supply of diesel/AGO, which fell short of the specification required to operate our rolling stock, which was outrightly rejected after statutory laboratory test,” NRC had said.
