The Patriotic Youth Front of Nigeria (PYFN) says former president Olusegun Obasanjo is unfit to advise Nigerians on who to vote for during the 2023 presidential election. On Sunday, Obasanjo, in a letter to Nigerians, declared his support for Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP). He advised Nigerians not to be “confused nor gullible” about who to vote for because Obi has what it takes to put Nigeria on the right path to progress. However, in a statement by Maxwell Ogar, PYFN president, the group said Obasanjo is attempting to rewrite history and beatify himself “as the hero of Nigeria’s eventual triumph when in reality the former president symbolizes everything that ails our dear nation”. “Obasanjo’s hands are stained with innocent blood, which makes him unfit to advise the Nigerian youth on whom to vote for president,” the statement reads. “Obasanjo’s endorsement of Peter Obi is rather a disservice to the upcoming national politician instead of being a boost because there is ample evidence that whatever this erstwhile civilian dictator lays his hands upon turns to dust. “His endorsement of the OBIdient brand has consequently doomed the Peter Obi candidacy as Obasanjo’s track record of satanic evil will haunt the LP candidate’s presidential bid. “We find it necessary to call out former President Obasanjo for his devious double standard and attempt to scam Nigerians as to his true identity. The same Obasanjo, who ceremonially shredded his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) membership card as he swore off politics, has now appointed himself the Labour Party’s chief marketer.”
