The minority caucus in the house of representatives has applauded the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for extending the deadline on the validity of the old naira notes. The apex bank, on Sunday, announced the extension of its previous deadline for the full transition to new naira notes. In a statement issued on Sunday, Ndudi Elumelu, leader of the minority caucus, said the extension will ease the suffering of Nigerians. “The 10 days extension of deadline from January 31, 2023, to February 10, 2023, is a welcome decision to ease the suffering as well as social and economic discomfort being faced by many Nigerians in accessing the new naira notes within the earlier stipulated deadline,” the statement reads. “As lawmakers and representatives of the people, our caucus commends the CBN for being considerate towards the wellbeing of Nigerians, which is the essence of democratic governance all over the world. “Our Caucus applauds the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar, for his intervention in persuading President Muhammadu Buhari and CBN to extend the earlier deadline in the national interest. “His Excellency Atiku Abubakar’s patriotic intervention at this time further shows him as a compassionate leader who is always concerned and committed towards the wellbeing of Nigerians. He has again demonstrated his experience, capacity, and competence to get the system to work in the interest of Nigerians at very critical time. “The Minority Caucus also urges the CBN to remain focused and intensify its sensitisation efforts while putting every measure in place to assist Nigerians, especially those in the rural areas, to access the new naira notes.”
