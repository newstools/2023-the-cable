Gunmen have reportedly kidnapped two residents of Oluwalose community in Ilorin, Kwara state capital. The gunmen were said to have invaded the community using motorcycles in the early hours of Tuesday. Buhari Tunde, the chairman of the community, is one of the residents said to have been kidnapped during the incident. Ajayi Okasanmi, police spokesperson in Kwara, told TheCable on Wednesday evening that two people, including the community chairman, were kidnapped. Okasanmi, however, said Tunde had been rescued by the police and that one resident is still in captivity. “When we heard the information, the commissioner of police, CP Paul Odama, dispatched police officers to the community,” the police spokesperson said. “The chairman of the community, Buhari Tunde, had been rescued this morning and we are on the verge of rescuing the second person. That is what is on the ground now. “One was rescued and the other is still with the kidnappers. Only two people were kidnapped.” The development comes amid attacks recorded in the state in recent months. In November 2022, a cleric and his son were abducted by gunmen in the Oko-Olowo area of Ilorin, Kwara capital.
