The national working committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has reversed the suspension of two members of the Ekiti state chapter of the party. The members are Funso Ayeni, Ekiti north senatorial candidate, and Ajayi Babatunde Samuel, Ekiti north II federal constituency candidate. On January 20, the PDP announced the suspension of Ayeni, Samuel, Chimaroke Nnamani, senator representing Enugu west senatorial district, and five others over “anti-party activities”. The party had said the decision was taken after an “extensive review” of the party’s activities in the country in line with the PDP constitution. In a statement on Saturday, Debo Ologunagba, PDP publicity spokesperson, said the PDP candidates have shown “manifest remorse” and apologised over their conduct. Ologunagba said Ayeni and Samuel have been fully restored as members. “This decision of the NWC is sequel to the report of the Disciplinary Committee which recommended the lifting of the suspension on Prince Funso Ayeni, Otunba Ajayi Babatunde Samuel on the ground of manifest remorse, apology for their conduct, affirmed loyalty to the Party and the PDP Constitution (as amended in 2017) as well as renewed commitment towards the success of the PDP at all levels in the 2023 general elections,” the statement reads. “By the lifting of the suspension, the status of Prince Funso Ayeni and Otunba Ajayi Babatunde Samuel as members of the PDP and especially as PDP Candidates for Ekiti North Senatorial District and Ekiti North II Federal Constituency respectively in the 2023 general election are fully restored. “The NWC urges all members, supporters and teeming members of our Party in Ekiti State to remain united and continue to work together for the success of the PDP at all levels in the 2023 general elections.”
