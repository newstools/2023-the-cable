President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the reappointment of Obadiah Nkom as the director general of Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office (MCO). The appointment was confirmed by Femi Adesina, spokesperson to the president in a statement on Tuesday. The four-term appointment takes effect from January 12, 2023. Nkom was among the 19 heads of government agencies appointed on January 12, 2019, for an initial period of four years. Adesina, in the statement, said under the leadership of Nkom in the past four years, the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office recorded 86 percent increase in revenue generation. He added that the office raked in over N8.9 billion between 2019 and 2021, compared to N4.8 billion generated in the corresponding period of 2016 to 2018. This also accounted for about 50 percent of the contribution of the ministry of mines and steel development to the economy. “His recently unveiled reforms in the automation of the mining cadastre system had revolutionised online and real-time mineral title administration and management, ” the statement reads. “It is also to the credit of Nkom during his first term that the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office was named the best agency of the federal government in the category of digital innovation awards for the year 2022. “This was done under the auspices of the Nigeria Internet Registration Association (NIRA), for adding value to the activities of the cadastre office.”
