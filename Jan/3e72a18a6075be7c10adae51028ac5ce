The All Progressives Congress (APC), in Zamfara, says some thugs attacked its members in Kaura Namoda LGA of the state on Monday. In a statement, Yusuf Idris, spokesperson of the party, said “innocent” people were attacked and vehicles destroyed in the process. Idris said the chaos was capable of creating a crisis in the state. “What happened in Maguru village of Kaura Namoda LGA where political thugs attacked part of the APC campaign motorcade destroying vehicles was uncalled for,” he said. “The affected vehicles included the State Radio Outside Broadcast (OB) van, the state radio chairman’s vehicle, ZAROTA vehicle, and many other vehicles belonging to the APC members as well as innocent commuters. “This is an unacceptable act capable of causing a serious crisis in the state should the APC respond in the same jungle way. “The thugs were seen by Maguru residents being dropped by a yellow vehicle earlier in the day, indicating that they were deployed from somewhere to perpetrate the dastardly act and evacuated without being traced.” Idris said the party has lodged a complaint with the authorities and would not stop petitioning the authorities until they get justice. “We are appealing to our members to remain calm as usual,” he said. “We also wish to commend security operatives who ensured the return of peace in the area.”
