Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has dismissed the endorsement of Peter Obi by former President Olusegun Obasanjo. On Sunday, the former president formally announced his support for Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP). Speaking on Thursday at a rally in Benin, the Edo capital, the APC candidate said Obasanjo is trying to deceive Nigerians by endorsing Obi. “Can that man recommend a leader for you in Nigeria? Is that not sending an agent to pick your pocket? A blind leading the blind,” Tinubu said. “I am sorry I am not insulting visually-impaired people. But it won’t work; they will end up in the ditch. If I talk about Obasanjo and Obi, you will think they are human beings together. One who doesn’t know the way cannot show the way.” Tinubu also criticised Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), saying the latter “fought” with Obasanjo when the duo was in charge of the country’s affairs. “The right leadership [to correct] those errors of those who are fighting naked in Wuse market in Abuja. Obasanjo and Atiku — or you were not in high school when they fought naked?” he asked. “Show me a good job that Atiku has done before? Show me one; you can’t find it. He is not the smartest in customs. A customs officer who cannot define the ethics of civil service provision.”
