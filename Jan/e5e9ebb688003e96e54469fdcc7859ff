Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), returned to Nigeria early Monday morning and is now back at his office in Abuja, TheCable understands. Emefiele, who went on leave before Christmas, has been in the news as it emerged that the Department of State Services (DSS) tried to arrest him in December 2022. His leave expired on Sunday, January 15, and not the January 17 date earlier reported by TheCable. He spent the first part of his leave in the US and was in the UK until Sunday evening from where he flew back to Nigeria and arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, on Monday morning. TheCable learnt from CBN sources that Emefiele presided over a number of meetings immediately he reported to office. The DSS had approached a federal high court in Abuja seeking a warrant to arrest him over allegations that he was involved in terrorism financing and economic crimes. In declining the motion ex parte — usually filed by an applicant in the absence of the respondent — Justice JT Tsoho, the chief judge, said the secret police did not provide any concrete evidence to substantiate its claims. There were suggestions that the bid to arrest Emefiele might be political given the impact the redesign of the naira and limit on cash withdrawals might have on vote-buying in the 2023 elections. A group of civil society organisations raised the alarm that there was a plot to frame Emefiele for terrorism and remove him from office. However, the DSS swiftly warned against anyone being used to “undermine” its investigations, although it did not specifically name Emefiele. Peter Afunanya, DSS spokesperson, said the service would not be distracted by those seeking to use “propaganda” to undermine its lawful investigations. A federal capital territory (FCT) high court sitting in Maitama later issued an order restraining the  DSS from arresting the CBN governor. The restraining order was issued by M.A. Hassan, the presiding judge.
