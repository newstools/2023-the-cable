Uba Sani, the governorship candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna, says if elected, he will make quality education accessible to everyone in the state. Sani said this on Tuesday at the flag-off of the Kaduna APC campaign rally in Giwa LGA. He said public schools were abandoned during the administration of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), adding that Nasir el-Rufai, governor of the state, restored the education sector. “My priority is to make quality education accessible to the siblings of the common man because that will guarantee them a better future and improve society at large,” he said. The governorship candidate said he would build on el-Rufai’s legacy to transform the education sector, adding that traditional leaders will also be empowered as they are crucial to the development of the society. “The projects that have been executed in the local government wouldn’t have been possible without your support. I want you to continue supporting APC by voting our party at all levels in the coming election,” he added. Meanwhile, before the rally, Nasir el-Rufai, governor of the state, inaugurated a neighbourhood sports centre, while Hadiza Balarabe, deputy governor, commissioned an obstetrics and gynaecology centre in the state.
