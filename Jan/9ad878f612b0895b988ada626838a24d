Biodun Ajiboye, the assistant director of media and publicity of the APC presidential campaign, says Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) has nothing significant to contribute to Nigeria’s development. In an interview aired on Tuesday on NTA, Ajiboye said if Nigeria is “rotten”, Obi is one of those that contributed to bringing Nigeria to that state. He said the former governor of Anambra doesn’t have the necessary experience that qualifies him to be the next president of Nigeria. “He was governor in Anambra. Notable people in the state have come out to say he was empty and he did nothing. I wonder why they think in 2023, Peter Obi will be the saviour of Nigeria,” he said. “If Nigeria is rotten and you point at people who have contributed to the rot of Nigeria, Peter Obi is actually one of them. Where did he get this rejuvenation that people are beginning to celebrate? “To be president of Nigeria is not a tea party. It is not a question of playing on people’s intelligence. “Let’s look at the place of experience in running Nigeria. The experience of Peter Obi is nothing to talk about that, that is why he doesn’t talk about his experience in Anambra.” Obi was governor on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) before he joined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2014. He later left the PDP in May 2022 and joined the LP where he secured the party’s presidential ticket.
