Gunmen have abducted Joshua Ahmadu, the district head of Chawai in Kauru LGA of Kaduna state. Abel Adamu, president of Chawai development association (CDA), confirmed the news. In a statement by Raphael Joshua, public relations officer of the CDA quoted Adamu as saying the traditional ruler was kidnapped on Tuesday night. He said the gunmen invaded Ahmadu’s residence at Zambina around 9:30 pm. “It was reported that the kidnappers stormed the house of the traditional ruler in their numbers around 9:30 pm and took him away,” Adamu said. He assured residents that the CDA was working hard to ensure that he is released unhurt. “Already, relevant authorities and heads of security operatives on special duty in the chiefdom have been duly informed and have already swung into action to rescue the traditional ruler,” he said. “We are calling on all sons and daughters of Tsam land to pray for the safe return of the district head.” The CDA president advised the youths of the chiefdom to take communal security seriously to avert security breaches. “We have to be on our feet to ensure the land is safe,” he said. “It’s unfortunate that at this critical time, the youths, who ought to be the communal force to guarantee security across communities, are not ready to work in collaboration with security personnel to secure the land.” Adamu also appealed to the government to direct security agencies to ensure that the district head is rescued and released “unconditionally”.
