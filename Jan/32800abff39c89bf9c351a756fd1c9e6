Umoh Ekop, chairperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ibiono Ibom LGA of Akwa Ibom state, has dismissed the reported expulsion of Ita Enang, a former aide of President Muhammadu Buhari, from the party. The state working committee of the party in Akwa Ibom had expelled Enang on the basis of recommendations purportedly put forward by his ward. The former presidential aide is accused of working against the interest of the APC in the state. Speaking on Thursday at a media briefing in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom capital, Ekop said Enang did not commit any offence that would warrant his expulsion from the party. “Ordinarily, we would have allowed the said publication, knowing that it is meaningless and does not have the weight capacity of distracting the party nor the distinguished senator Ita Enang, who is the backbone of the party in the LGA and state levels,” he said. “For the sake of the public, who may be misled to believe this lies from the pit of hell, we want to put the record straight, that Enang is still a member of APC, eastern ward 2, Ibiono Ibom LGA of Akwa Ibom. “We have not received any news or petition from the ward chairman of eastern ward 2 against him at any time. “Enang is the only light and voice of the party at the local level as well as the known voice in Akwa Ibom that has always been speaking for the party. “I urge all leaders and teeming members of our great party to please ignore the same and continue working with me and all other party leaders and members of the party for the success of the party in all the elections.”
