Yusuf Tsoho, the Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate in Jigawa has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a statement on Friday, Habibu Nuhu Kila, media adviser to Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, governor of Jigawa, said his principal formally received Tsoho into the party at the state house in Dutse. The media adviser quoted Abubakar as saying that Tsoho and his supporters would be accorded every right enjoyed by the old members of the party. Kila quoted Tsoho as citing APC’s qualities for championing the yearnings and aspirations of the electorate as his reasons for joining the party. Meanwhile, Abubakar Marke, Kaugama constituency candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Jigawa house of assembly has defected to the APC. Auwal Sankara, Jigawa commissioner for special duties, announced the development in a statement on Friday. Sankara said Marke made his decision of joining the APC known after a meeting with the state’s governor. Marke said the APC aligns more closely with his values and beliefs, adding that he would be able to serve his constituents better under his new party. The development comes days after eight state house of assembly candidates of the LP  defected to the APC. The defectors are from Auyo, Kirikasamma, Bulangu, Malam Madori, Kafin Hausa, Birniwa, Guri, and Kaugama constituencies.
