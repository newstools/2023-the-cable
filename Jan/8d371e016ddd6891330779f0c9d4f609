Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has reacted to the tribunal judgment sacking Ademola Adeleke as governor of Osun. In August 2022, Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) petitioned the Osun governorship election petition tribunal to challenge Adeleke’s election victory. Delivering the judgment on Friday, the Osun governorship election petition tribunal sacked Adeleke as governor of the state. Two out of a three-member panel of the tribunal held that there was proof of over-voting in some of the polling units. The tribunal also ruled that Oyetola won the election with 314,931 votes to defeat Adeleke who scored 290,666. Reacting to the tribunal judgment in a statement, Abubakar described the happenings as a phase in the struggle of liberation of Osun. “On today’s verdict of the election petition tribunal in Osun state, I stand in solidarity with the good people of Osun state who overwhelmingly voted for the Peoples Democratic Party and gave their mandate to His Excellency Governor Demola Adeleke,” he said. “What has happened at the tribunal today is a phase in the struggle to liberate Osun state and I am sure that at the conclusion of the whole process, the people shall be victorious. “I therefore call on the people of Osun to continue to have faith in their governor elected into office in popular ballot. This light that has shone on Osun shall never go dim.” Meanwhile, also in reaction to the court ruling, Adeleke has said he would appeal the judgment.
