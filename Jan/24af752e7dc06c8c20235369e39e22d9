Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has condemned the attack on a train station in Edo state. TheCable had reported how gunmen attacked and kidnapped several persons at the station in Igueben LGA of the state on Saturday. At least 30 people were reportedly kidnapped while six of the victims have been rescued. Reacting in a statement signed by Tunde Rahman, his media aide, Tinubu described the incident as “another sad episode in the security challenges facing the country”. Tinubu sympathised with the victims who are still being held captive and urged the federal government, Edo government, and local authorities to work with the security agencies on how to secure their release. “I condemn the mindless attack and abduction of innocent train passengers in Edo State by terrorists on Saturday,” the statement reads. “From available information, the security agencies are working hard to rescue the victims. I urge more collaborative efforts by the Federal Government, Edo State Government and other local authorities on quick rescue of all the victims. “This occurrence is a sad reminder that we have not completely won the war against insecurity and that there are still some agents of darkness lurking around the corner. But I want to assure Nigerians we will win this war. Evil will not prevail over our country because of our strong determination to exterminate the dark forces everywhere they manifest. “One of the reasons I am running for the presidency is to improve on security situation and tackle every form of insecurity in our country. We have a clear plan to end violent crimes and terrorism through our Anti-Terrorism Battalion Forces, investment in more security hardware and surveillance technology that will make our streets, neighbourhood and forests saver for socio-economic activities to thrive and bloom.” The APC presidential candidate said Nigeria would prevail against the agents of darkness.
