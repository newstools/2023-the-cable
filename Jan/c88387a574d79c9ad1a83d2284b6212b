Gboyega Oyetola, former governor of Osun, was on Tuesday welcomed back to the state by members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his former cabinet members. The former governor had left the state two days after the swearing-in of his successor, Ademola Adeleke, on November 27, 2022. Addressing his supporters in Osogbo, the state capital, Oyetola said God has informed him that he will retrieve his mandate and that the election tribunal will declare him the winner of the governorship election. “I am very happy to return home. I can see you have been longing to see me. I had wanted to enter the state quietly but was surprised with this rousing welcome,” he said. “I did not tell anybody that I was returning to the state early this morning and I am surprised to be welcomed by this massive crowd. Thank you very much. “This year will be a great year for us all; our clerics have urged us not to doubt God over our prayers. The promise of God will come to pass. “God has told me that He will do two things for us this year; we are going to retrieve our mandate (in Osun) and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu will become the president of Nigeria. “I only went to rest. You can see how fresh I am looking now. I served Osun wholeheartedly for four years without resting and God intentionally orchestrated my rest for a while.” Oyetola asked his supporters to work for the APC in the forthcoming elections, urging them not to be distracted. He also called on residents of the state to collect their permanent voter cards (PVCs). “I am scared that Osun has about one million voter cards uncollected. Please go and collect your PVCs and let us deliver one million votes for Tinubu and Shettima,” he said.
