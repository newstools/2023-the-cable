In a tweet on Sunday, Dayo Israel, national youth leader of the APC, tweeted a picture of a sample of the rice. “Coming soon,” Israel tweeted.

It is unclear if the packs of rice will be sold or given out to voters – a usual occurrence around elections. The youth campaign council of the ruling party, known as “Jagaban’s army”, is largely made up of the elite of the APC. The children of President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, and Yusuf Bichi, director-general of the Department of State Services (DSS) are members of the council. While unveiling the youth council in December 2022, Israel tweeted: “It is such a honour to welcome those that have gone ahead of me; from the legacy parties national youth leaders to the APC former youth leaders beginning from Dasuki Jallo to Sadiq Abubakar and Ismael Ahmed – to provide their support to the APC Nat Youth Wing Campaign Council. “I am also honoured to invite and welcome the children of the current first and second family/and the offspring of the incoming first and second family as well as children of many APC first families to join us as we engage the next generation for our party and our candidate.”
