Duoye Diri, governor of Bayelsa, says the unity of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is of priority as the 2023 elections draw close. Diri spoke to journalists after a visit to Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta. Godwin Obaseki, Edo governor, was also present. He said the party hopes to discuss with the G5 governors to convince them to support the PDP and work for the victory of its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. “We want a united PDP and each time we meet, we focus and discuss the unity,” he said. “We are not ruling out speaking to our brothers. Even today, we have also discussed the possibility of speaking to them to return to our party. “We are calling on our brother-governors to be part of their own party and work in unity with every other person. We still want our brother governors back so we can visit them the way we visited our brother, Governor Okowa, who by God’s grace will be the vice-president of Nigeria.” Also speaking on the meeting in Delta, Obaseki said it was to congratulate Okowa and to wish him well in the election. “It is a new year. We go round felicitating as a family to wish each other well and pray the new year brings good tidings to the party,” he said. “We are here today to visit our brother, senator Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta state and vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2023 presidential election. “We wish him well in this election year and by the grace of God, he will be the next vice-president of Nigeria. “We pray God Almighty will make our dreams come true this 2023.” See photos below.
