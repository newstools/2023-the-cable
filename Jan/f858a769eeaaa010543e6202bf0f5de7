Datti Baba-Ahmed, vice-presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says Nigeria will never fail to qualify for the World Cup if the party is elected. Baba-Ahmed spoke during a town hall meeting organised by Channels Television on Sunday. The Super Eagles of Nigeria did not qualify for the recently concluded Qatar 2022 World Cup after Ghana pipped them to the ticket in March 2022. The development was a sour grape for lovers of football in the country as they watched other African countries take part in the competition. Speaking on sports development and entertainment, Baba-Ahmed said the LP government will “move mountains” to ensure Nigeria wins the next African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Ivory Coast. He added that to achieve the objectives, the LP administration would ensure that people who represent Nigeria in sports are never owed salaries and allowances. “Let me appreciate the contribution of Nigerian youth in bringing the country out to the world and contributing value to our GDP,” the LP vice-presidential candidate said. “It was painful to watch the 2022 World Cup without the Super Eagles. But when the African Cup of Nations comes up next, I will ensure we move mountains to make sure the cup comes to Nigeria. “And there is no way the World Cup will be played without Nigeria, we have passed that stage. It will never happen again. “This is entertainment – sport is entertainment – and then we are going to proliferate with infrastructure and [the] reward [will be] coming to the participants. “Never will salaries or allowances of Nigerian players be delayed by one hour. We will be there to ensure they are compensated, link them with industries and companies and raise their profiles internationally.” The Eagles will resume their AFCON qualification campaign in March, a few weeks after the presidential poll which is billed for February 25.
