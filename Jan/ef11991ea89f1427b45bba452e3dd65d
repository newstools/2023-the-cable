Seyi Tinubu, son of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has asked the Miyetti-Allah Kautal Hore association to support his father. Seyi made the request on Thursday during a visit to Abdullahi Bodejo, the national president of the association. He was accompanied by members of City Boy Youth Movement (CBYM), a Tinubu/Shettima support group. For “renewed hope for Nigeria”, Tinubu’s son urged  Nigerian youths to vote for the APC in the next month’s elections. “Let us all go and collect our PVCs before the deadline and vote APC. A vote for Tinubu/Shettima will carry the youth along as a priority as stated in their manifesto,” NAN quoted Seyi as saying. He said the youth wing of the APC and the CBYM would work together with the Fulani to ensure that the party wins in the country. Bodejo in his remarks called on members of the association to support the candidacy of Tinubu/Shetima. He said the decision to endorse the APC candidates was due to Miyetti- Allah’s community engagement with stakeholders and community leaders across the country. According to NAN, Seyi Tinubu was conferred with the chieftaincy title of “Sokajo Fulbe” —the ambassador of the Fulani youths. Favour Abayomi, leader of CBYM, described Tinubu and Shettima of the APC as the “best candidates for the presidency”.
