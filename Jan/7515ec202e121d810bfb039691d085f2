The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has explained why Doyin Okupe, a chieftain of the Labour Party (LP), was arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS). TheCable had reported that Okupe was intercepted at terminal 1 of the Lagos airport by DSS at the instance of the EFCC, on Thursday. According to the EFCC, the former presidential adviser was billed to fly to London via a Virgin Atlantic flight before his arrest. Hours later, Okupe said he had been released, adding that senior officers of the EFCC have apologised for the “error”. Reacting to the development in a statement on Thursday, Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesperson, said DSS acted on a watchlist request made in July 2016, before the recent conviction of Okupe. “The Department of State Services, DSS, today, January 12, informed the commission of the interception of Dr. Doyin Okupe, former presidential adviser, at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos,” Uwujaren said. “The service acted on a watch-list request issued on July 18, 2016, over six years before his recent conviction on money laundering charges by the Federal High Court, Abuja. “The commission was in the process of formally lifting the watch-list before his interception and will expedite action in this regard.” In December 2022, Okupe was sentenced to two years imprisonment or the option to pay fine — totalling N13 million — over breach of the Money Laundering Act. He paid the fine shortly after the sentencing. Following the conviction, Okupe had stepped down as the director-general of the LP presidential campaign council.
