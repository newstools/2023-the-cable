Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese football star, has explained his decision to join Saudi Arabia’s Al-Nassr despite “interest from some European teams.” Ronaldo spoke during his unveiling to the club’s fans on Tuesday. On Friday, the Riyadh club announced the signing of the 37-year-old Portuguese on a two-and-a-half-year deal. The five-times Ballon D’Or winner will earn a total of €200 million per year — the highest salary ever paid to a professional footballer — once commercial agreements are included. Speaking at the unveiling, Ronaldo said he made the move because he has “won everything” in Europe. He added that while other clubs showed interest, he gave his “word to this club to develop not only football but the other parts of this amazing country”. “My work in Europe is done. I played at the most important clubs and I won everything. For me, now is a new challenge in Asia. I’m happy, and proud that Al Nassr gave me this opportunity,” he said. “As nobody knows but I can say now that I had so many opportunities in Europe with many clubs in Brazil, Australia and the US trying to sign me. But I gave my word to this club to develop not only football but the other parts of this amazing country. It is a challenge and a chance for me to help with my knowledge and experience.”
