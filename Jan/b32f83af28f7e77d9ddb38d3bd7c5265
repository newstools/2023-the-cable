Mai Mala Buni, Yobe governor, has declared Monday, January 9, and Tuesday, January 10, as work-free days ahead of President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to the state. Buni said this in a statement by Garba Bilal, Yobe head of service, in Damaturu on Sunday. According to Bilal, the president would be visiting the state to inaugurate the newly constructed cargo airport, ultra-modern market, and maternal and child health care complex. Bilal said the declaration of the two-day holiday will enable the people of the state to receive the president. “This is to enable civil servants and the general public to receive the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, who will be in the state on a one-day State Visit to commission projects,” NAN quoted Bilal as saying. Bila said civil servants were to resume work on Wednesday. On December 29, 2022, Buhari made a similar visit to Kogi to inaugurate projects completed by the state government in Okene LGA. Earlier before the president’s visit, TheCable reported that an explosion had rocked the community where he was to commission projects. The incident was said to have occurred at a mosque near the palace of Ado Ibrahim, the paramount ruler of Ebiraland.
