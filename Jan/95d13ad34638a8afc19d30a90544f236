Solly March scored twice in the second half as Liverpool succumbed to a 3-0 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at the Amex Stadium on Saturday. The injury-ravaged Reds were stung early in the second period, consigning Liverpool to consecutive league defeats following a mini-revival halted by Brentford. The hosts took the lead two minutes after the interval when Joel Matip’s mistake allowed Mitoma to set up March who dispatched a shot from close range into the net. The Seagulls doubled their advantage five minutes later when March, again, expertly picked his spot to bury his shot into the far corner. Danny Welbeck, the former Arsenal player, completed the rout late on with a fantastic solo goal, rolling it past Alisson Becker to seal the three points. Brighton climb above Liverpool to seventh position on the log with 30 points from 18 matches, one point ahead of Jurgen Klopp’s side. Earlier in the day, Manchester United came from a goal down to defeat Manchester City 2-1 and claim bragging rights in the Manchester derby. Man United should have been ahead in the first period but were denied by wayward finishing and City pounced early in the second half through Jack Grealish’s header. A late turnaround started with Bruno Fernandes scoring a controversial equaliser awarded by the VAR team on 80 minutes, with reviews claiming Marcus Rashford did not interfere in the play. Rashford would fittingly score the winner two minutes later, converting Gernacho’s cross. The win moves United to 38 points from 18 matches, one behind City. RESULTS Manchester United 2-1 Manchester City
