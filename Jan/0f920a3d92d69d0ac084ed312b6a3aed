The Osun governorship election petition tribunal has fixed January 27, 2023, to deliver its judgment. According to a notice pasted at the entrance of the court, the tribunal indicated that sitting will begin at 9am on the said day. In August 2022, Gboyega Oyetola, former Osun governor, and the All Progressives Congress (APC) petitioned the tribunal to challenge the election victory of Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Among several issues, Oyetola is contending that there was overvoting in 749 polling units across 10 LGAs of the state. Speaking on his expectations, Adeleke, the Osun governor, had expressed optimism about victory at the tribunal. On its part, the Osun state chapter of the APC had recently asked its members to commence seven-day fasting and prayer for favourable judgment at the tribunal. Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had said Adeleke would win the Osun governorship election even if results from polling units contested by Oyetola were exempted. INEC, in its final written address by Paul Ananaba, counsel to the commission, insisted that Adeleke won the governorship poll. “The petitioners complained of over-voting and infractions by picking 749 polling units to contend with from 1,750 polling units, according to the first respondent witnessed (RW1),” Ananaba had said. “If a deduction of 1,750 units was carried out from the total 3,763 units in the state, the second respondent will still emerge as the winner with over 20,000 votes.”
