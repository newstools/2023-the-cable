Isaac Balami has been appointed as the senior special adviser on presidential campaign matters, fundraising, and grassroot mobilisation for the Labour Party (LP) campaign council. In a letter signed by Julius Abure, LP national chairman, Balami’s appointment is said to be based on his knowledge, experience, and personal qualities of hard work in the party’s quest to win the 2023 presidential election. Balami is also a deputy manager for the Obi-Datti presidential campaign organisation. He was said to be the likely candidate to succeed Doyin Okupe, the former director-general of the LP campaign who resigned in December following his conviction over breach of the Money Laundering Act. But Balami had dismissed the speculations and asked that the public to disregard it. While accepting the letter on his additional role in the campaign, Balami said he is glad to be working with the party because he knows that Labour Party will deliver a new Nigeria. “I thank the party’s chairman and everyone who is working hard behind the scenes to ensure that a credible government pilots the affairs of the nation come February 2023,” he said. “I see this as a recognition of what the young people, especially the vibrant support groups, are doing. “This new office is a challenge to every young Nigerian to brace up and enthrone the Obi-Datti mandate.”
