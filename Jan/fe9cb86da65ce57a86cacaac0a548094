Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, says speculations won’t influence his decision on his preferred presidential candidate. In recent weeks, there have been speculations that Wike will work for the election of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In December, Wike and his allies travelled to London and there were claims that he met with Tinubu to conclude plans to endorse him — but the Rivers governor and the APC standard-bearer have dismissed the speculations. Speaking on Wednesday at the flag-off ceremony for the construction of Akpabu-Egbeda-Elele/Omoku link road in Emohua LGA of the state, Wike said he won’t be influenced by speculations. “Don’t make mistakes. All your votes, put it in one basket. Carry all, give us for governorship; give us for house of reps,” he told the crowd at the construction site. “Vote for us for senate. Vote for us for the house of assembly. But president, we will tell you how you will do it. “If anybody likes, say whatever you want to say. Say I’m working for a so-and-so person, it’s your business. That will not (influence me) or make me change my mind (about) where we’re heading to. “So, if they like, they make speculations. After all, that’s why the word ‘speculation’ is there. People must speculate, so let them continue to speculate. And let them know, some of them who do not even have 25 votes (are) busy abusing leaders. When you finish abusing leaders, you will pay. “We are here talking to our people; they are there in radio stations and television houses. We are here talking to our people. Anytime they come, ask them, ‘what did you bring for us?’”
