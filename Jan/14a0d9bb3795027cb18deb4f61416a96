Uba Sani, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna, has advised residents to vote for credible candidates. Sani spoke on Tuesday during a town hall meeting with stakeholders in the state. The governorship candidate, also senator representing Kaduna central, said he has sponsored 32 bills as a lawmaker, adding that he built schools and hospitals in his senatorial district. He also said he will ensure that residents are involved in the process of formulating and implementing policies if he is elected governor. “Vote for people who can contribute to deliberations at legislative chambers, in addition to bringing dividends of democracy to their constituencies,” he said. “Poverty doesn’t know tribe or religion. Our focus will be to empower youths and women with skills, as well as financial support to enable them to be self reliant as government can’t provide jobs for everyone.” The governorship candidate is currently on a campaign tour around the state.
