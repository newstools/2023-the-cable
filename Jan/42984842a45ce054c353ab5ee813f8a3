The United States says it is determined to support Ukraine till it achieves victory against Russia. Speaking at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday, Anthony Blinken, US secretary of state said the support America has provided has evolved to match Russia’s aggression. “As this aggression has evolved, so too has our assistance to Ukraine, making sure that it has what it needs to meet the aggression head-on,” Blinken said. “We have continuously provided what Ukraine needs and we are doing it in a way that makes sure we are responsive to what is actually happening on the battlefield as well as projecting where it might go. “We are determined to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to succeed on the battlefield.” He added that the US would be making further announcements in the coming days regarding the commitment. On his part, James Cleverly, British foreign secretary, said the UK would provide military equipment including army challenger 2, main battle tanks, and 14 challenger 2s. He urged the US to go “further and faster” in their support for Ukraine, pointing out that it was the biggest single supplier of assistance – both military and economic – to the European country. He added that the UK would continue to work “hand in glove” – along with other allies – to ensure Ukraine had the support it needed. Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky praised the secretaries for their efforts while asking them not to relent in their assistance. “Never in living memory has Russia been more isolated and the Atlantic alliance more united,” he said. “If Putin believed that the world would succumb to Ukraine fatigue and lose the will to resist his ambitions then that was once again another colossal misjudgment on his part.”
