Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) says it generated N574.3 billion in 2022 from operations at its TinCan Island Command. Olakunle Oloyede, the command area controller, spoke on Friday in Lagos. He said the figure represents an increase of N80.90 billion or 16.39 percent when compared with the N493.4 billion recorded in 2021. “This feat can be attributed to the constant rejigging of the existing measures geared toward sustaining the command’s revenue profile,” he said. “It is as well as utilisation of some disruptive strategic measures such as periodic capacity building, reshuffling and redeployment of officers using the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and implementation of the vehicle identification number (VIN) valuation.” “These led to timely intelligence sharing, utilisation and voluntary compliance to government’s extant laws by the trading public.” HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PORT’S ACTIVITY Oloyede also reeled out the highlights of some of the major activities that took place in the port in 2022. He said some seizures were made which comprise 763 kgs of colorado (cannabis sativa), 1,150 bales of second-hand clothing, 1,190 cartons of 20 per cartons of potassium bromate and baking powder, among others. “Also, 1,383 cartons of 50 rolls per carton of cigarettes, 650 cartons of 50 pieces per carton of new ladies shoes, 2,666 pieces in 36 pallets of new starter ex-premium inverter battery, 1,980 cartons of assorted non-alcoholic beverages and 1,048 cartons of Tilda basmati rice,” he said. Oloyede said officials seized 2,594 pieces of ammunition and 20 pieces of arms comprising one pistol with 611090 (S/W) model JCP 40mm, one used Co2 air pistol with accessories cal 117(4.5m)BM, one marksman repeater pistol, six Mace pepper gun and 10 suspected arms of various types. “A total of 60 suspects were detained in 2022 and were granted administrative bail while the command has 8 cases pending in court,” he added. Oloyede said the command recorded a significant increase in the free on board (FOB) of exports in the period under review to the tune of $589,696,648 (N242,365,322,333.00) as against the $496,075,796 (N141,985,109,159.00) recorded in 2021. He attributed the increase of 34.4 percent in the FOB to the high quality and value of exported commodities. “However, the export report shows a decrease in tonnage of export from 1,723,986.8 in 2021 to 336,179.5 in 2022,” he said. “The decrease in tonnage could be connected to current government fiscal policy which prohibited the export of wood and wood products as well as the global unrest with its concomitant economic challenges.” He listed the commodities exported through the command to include: cocoa beans, insecticides, dried ginger, empty bottles, soya beans, cashew nuts, cigarettes, rubbers, cocoa butter, frozen shrimps, copper ingots, aluminium ingots, and sesame seeds. “Cocoa beans were the highest exported commodity while the legend stout was the least exported commodity,” he said. “The future of export in the command looks brighter as the command in line with the headquarter circular on export Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) released a port order on the command’s harmonised SOP for the seamless facilitation of export trade in strict compliance with extant laws and guidelines on export.” Oloyede thanked all stakeholders and sister government agencies for seamless collaboration in facilitating the clearance process of export-related cargo.
