Chelsea have snapped up Joao Felix, the Portuguese forward, from Atletico Madrid on a loan deal. The club announced Felix’s signing with a terse statement on its website. Chelsea also welcomed the Portuguese international to the club via its Twitter handle. The time is now! — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) January 11, 2023  “Portuguese attacker Joao Felix will be part of the Chelsea squad for the remainder of the season, having moved to Stamford Bridge on loan from Atletico Madrid,” the statement reads. “The 23-year-old previously played for Benfica in his homeland before switching to the Spanish capital in the summer of 2019, for a record fee for both clubs. “A skilful and stylish attacker, Joao Felix is most effective when roaming fluidly across the forward line and involving himself in the build-up play.” According to Skysports, the Stamford Bridge side beat the duo of Arsenal and Manchester United to Felix’s signature after agreeing to a £10 million loan fee. The 23-year-old, who joins Chelsea after spending three years at Atletico Madrid, becomes the club’s fourth signing in the winter transfer window following the arrival of Benoit Badiashile, David Datro Fofana, and Andrey Santos earlier in the month. Felix joined Atletico from Benfica in a €126m (£111m) deal in 2019.
