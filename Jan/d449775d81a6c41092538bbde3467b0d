Desmond Akawo, the state chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers, says there is no room for any other party in the state. He said the party has won the trust of Rivers people through good governance, infrastructure delivery, and tourism development. Speaking on Friday at a beach party in the Ikuru area during the Andoni unity festival in the state, Akawo said the party will continue to invest in impactful achievements that will further create employment opportunities. He advised local government chairmen to “look inward and identify relevant economic potentials” in order to bring dividends of good governance to the people of the state. “As a party with direct interest of the people, we will indeed identify with this huge investment hub in Andoni,” he said. “The beach when harnessed will not only create employment opportunities and revenue for the state but also has the capacity of attracting International recognition whenever tourism is mentioned. “We drove to Ikuru Town Beach by road courtesy of PDP, indeed, there’s no room for other political parties in the 6,866 polling units of the state. “I’m sure we don’t need to persuade Andoni to vote for our party and candidate Mr Siminialayi Fubara in the forthcoming gubernatorial election because the soil texture in Andoni is PDP, the DNA of the people of Andoni is PDP. “Tourism is a capital-intensive venture that requires more than what the local government council can afford. That is the reason we are calling on investors, operating oil companies and government.”
