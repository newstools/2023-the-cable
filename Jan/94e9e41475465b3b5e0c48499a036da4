Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, has hinted that talks with his political allies on the candidate to support in the presidential election will soon be concluded. According to a statement by Kelvin Ebiri, his spokesperson, Wike spoke on Tuesday at St. Martin’s Anglican Church, Omagwa town, venue of the LGA flag-off rally of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers state. Wike said the beauty of the forthcoming election is that it will leave no room for any form of electoral manipulation and intimidation from security personnel. “This time, no army will do anything. No Fakorode will do anything. No police will do anything. Now, it is one man, one vote. All the votes must be in one basket from governorship to house of assembly. The other one we are concluding. When we conclude, you will be told,” he said. “Nobody should intimidate you. Nobody should tell you any story. We are free-born of this country. We are not second-class citizens. Nobody can tell us anything. I dare them. Let anybody do any funny thing, We’ll tell them we are from Rivers state. “As we finish from here now, you’ll go home and start working before the appropriate time when we will ring the bell. When you hear the bell ringing, know that the decision has been taken.” Wike’s comment comes amid speculations over which presidential candidate the G5 governors will support, amid the crisis in the PDP.
