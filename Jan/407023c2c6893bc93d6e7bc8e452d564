Kenneth Okonkwo, the campaign spokesperson of the Labour Party (LP) presidential campaign council, has taken a swipe at Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In an interview on Channels Television, Okonkwo praised Peter Obi, the LP presidential candidate, who spoke at the Chatham House in the United Kingdom earlier on Monday. Obi, who delivered a speech and answered questions afterwards, promised to “destroy the structure” that has kept Nigerians in poverty if elected president. Meanwhile, on December 5, Tinubu, while at the Chatham House, delegated some questions directed to him to some persons on his team. Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives, and Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, were part of the team members that answered questions on Tinubu’s behalf. In a separate development, at an APC presidential rally in Ondo on January 7, Tinubu described Obi as “Mr Stingy”, and said the LP candidate’s policy on saving state funds is a recipe for underdevelopment. Speaking on Obi’s feature at the Chatham House, Okonkwo, who aimed a dig at Tinubu over the latter’s decision to delegate questions, expressed satisfaction with the LP candidate’s outing in the UK. “His appearance today at Chatham House is not just an appearance that will further Labour Party or further his candidacy, but his appearance has projected Nigeria as a pride of the black race, has projected Nigeria for what it is — the giant of Africa,” Okonkwo said. “I’m so proud of my principal who was so stingy that he went to Chatham House and refused to share questions. “He was answering the questions, in contradiction to the generous APC candidate who went there and shared the questions for other people to answer.”
