A train said to be a few minutes from its destination in Abuja has derailed. The incident occurred on Friday afternoon in the Kubwa area of the federal capital territory (FCT). It is not clear if there are casualties from the incident. A resident of the area, who spoke to TheCable, said “people were just thanking God that it was not on the highway tracks”. When TheCable visited the scene of the incident, there were no passengers on the train. However, police officers and officials of the Nigerian Railway Corporation are currently at the scene of the incident. The NRC officials did not give details of what happened, but said they “are assessing the situation”. See photos below.
