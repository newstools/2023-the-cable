FAME Foundation and Laureus Sports for Good, a London-based not-for-profit organisation (NGO), have entered a one-year partnership to provide change through sports under the “Play it Dream it initiative”. “Play it Dream it Initiative” is aimed at using sports as a tool for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), improving access to quality and affordable education, reducing early marriage, promoting gender equality and sports participation, and contributing to the reduction in inequalities among children and young adults in Nigeria. The project is aimed at young children — boys and girls aged 7-17 — through several activities like football for development and other sports. Over 200 displaced children are billed to participate in the weekly and monthly sporting activities and exercises, including mentorship and empowerment programmes. According to a statement by Inyene Idiong, communication officer at FAME Foundation, the partnership will enable both organizations to take advantage of their collective strength and reach out to wider audiences, transform lives and also bring development to the people. He added that the initiative unifies the idea of women and girls coming together through sports to better themselves and society. Aderonke Ogunleye-Bello, executive director of FAME Foundation, said the project would position the beneficiaries for better access to support and development. “Our focus is to advocate alongside the people, amplify their voices, and bring them closer to where they can access the relevant support, participate in their development and ultimately, sustainably exit their crises and we are elated at this partnership with Laureus Sports, and with optimism, we look forward to the outstanding growth that will be achieved by the organizations and the project beneficiaries,” she said.
