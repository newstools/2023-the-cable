Douye Diri, governor of Bayelsa, says the estimated 250,000 out-of-school children in the state are alarming. According to NAN, the governor spoke on Tuesday during the inauguration of a national campaign on out-of-school children by the federal ministry of education in Yenagoa, the state capital. Diri said the out-of-school figure is worrisome, considering the state has an existing law that makes education compulsory for children. He, however, did not disclose the source of the estimate. The governor called on parents and community leaders to support his administration’s efforts to change the narrative in the state. According to him, the government has continued to support free primary and secondary education in the state with the purchase of uniforms and instructional materials. Diri also called on the state house of assembly to perform its oversight role on laws on education and ensure they are implemented. “A law was passed by the Bayelsa state house of assembly on this matter in 2018. Bayelsa state has started addressing the issue long before now,” he said. “The campaign by the federal government is a key that has opened our eyes to the level of out-of-school children in our state. “The issue is mostly about implementation. We have the laws to ensure that our children are educated. This law has to be implemented across all our communities. “The ministries of information and education must do all within their powers to ensure that the public is aware of this law and it is implemented.” Also speaking at the event,  Goodluck Nanah-Opiah, the minister of state for education, who led the campaign, said education remains a collective responsibility. He called on all stakeholders to join forces to eradicate the menace of out-of-school children in the interest of the country. Nanah-Opiah said the federal ministry of education has put mechanisms in place to ensure education is accessible to children of school age in Nigeria.
