President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to be in Lagos on a two-day working visit to commission projects in the state. At the test run of the first phase of the blue line rail project on December 21, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the governor of Lagos, said Buhari would commission the first phase of the project (Marina to Mile 2) in January 2023, and also flag off construction of phase two (Mile 2 to Okokomaiko). Jubril Gawat, senior special assistant to the governor on new media, announced on Friday that the president will visit the state on January 23 and 24 for the commissioning of several “legacy projects”. Gawat said the projects include the Lekki deep sea port, the blue line rail project designed to run from Mile 2 (on the mainland) to Marina, 32-Metric tons Lagos Rice Mill, Imota, and 18.75km Eleko to Epe T Junction express road. Others are the John Randle centre for Yoruba culture and history and the groundbreaking for the blue line rail phase 2 (Mile 2 to Okokomaiko). “President Buhari will be on a 2-day working visit to Lagos state on the 23rd and 24th of January, 2023 to commission various legacy projects,” Gawat wrote on Twitter.
