The senate has confirmed Solomon Arase, a former inspector-general of police (IGP), as chairperson of the Police Service Commission (PSC). President Muhammadu Buhari had asked the upper legislative chamber to confirm him in line with sections 153 (1) and 154 (1) of the constitution as amended. Arase was screened by the senate police committee on Tuesday. While presenting a report on the screening on Wednesday, Haliru Jika, chairman of the police affairs committee, said the former IGP met the requirements to hold the office. Speaking after Jika’s submission, Matthew Urhoghide, senator representing Edo south, said Arase’s nomination “is a round peg in a round hole”. “Let me commend this Committee for this thorough job they have done. On behalf of the good people of Edo state, we want to thank Mr. President C-in-C for nominating Dr. Solomon Arase to be appointed as chairman of the Police Service Commission,” he said. “I want to urge my colleagues to expeditiously confirm Mr. Arase as Chairman of the Police Service Commission.” Thereafter, Arase was confirmed as the PSC chair after his nomination was put to a vote by Senate President Ahmad Lawan.
