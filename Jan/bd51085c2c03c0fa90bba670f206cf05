Chris Okotie, founder of the Household of God Church, says Nigeria needs restructuring to guarantee its economic future. Okotie said this in his New Year message contained in a statement issued on Thursday by Ladi Ayodeji, his spokesperson. He said stable policies and structures are missing from the current administration, adding that Nigeria’s future can be guaranteed when the country is restructured. He also said unless his “aboriginal democracy” proposition is adopted, the country could suffer a severe socio-political and economic crisis. The cleric said the country’s failures are evident in the constant borrowing “given the fact that 80 percent of our income is used to service our current debt 77 trillion naira”. “In the light of this reality, a new constitution is required to deal with all the existential problems in all spheres of our national life, which is why aboriginal democracy is recommended,” Okotie said. The former presidential candidate urged his congregation to pray for the peace and prosperity of Nigeria. “Every member of this church should continue to set aside a few hours to pray for Nigeria because the Household of God was set up to play a pivotal role in the destiny of this country, that’s why I am involved in the political process,” he added.
