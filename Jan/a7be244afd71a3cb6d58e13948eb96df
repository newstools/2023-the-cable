Joseph Edgar also known as the duke of Shomolu is set to hold the “common man’s edition” of an online presidential town hall meeting. The town hall meeting is scheduled to hold on  Sunday, January 29 at 5 pm. The programme is in partnership with TheCable and The Alvin Report. It will feature five ordinary Nigerians representing the All Progressives Congress (APC), Labour Party (LP), People’s Democratic Party (PDP), New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), and Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). While moderated by Edgar, the representatives will debate on issues such as the economy, security, health, and education. Attendance is free and open to all passionate Nigerians wishing to change the narrative. The announcement of the town hall meeting comes a few weeks before the general election in Nigeria as candidates campaign to the masses. Concerns have been raised about the possibility of postponement of the elections due to insecurity in some parts of the country. But Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) recently assured that the commission has no such plans. “The commission is not contemplating, let alone planning to postpone the 2023 general election. We’re going ahead to conduct it as scheduled,” Yakubu said.
