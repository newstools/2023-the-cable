The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has condemned the murder of Isaac Achi, a priest of St. Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Niger state. Achi was burnt to death on Sunday when gunmen attacked his residence in Kafin-Koro, Paikoro LGA of Niger. In a statement on Sunday, Belusochukwu Enwere, chairperson of the youth wing of the association, described the incident as “wicked and barbaric”, and expressed concern over the spate of attacks on Christian clerics in the country. “The continuous killing as well as kidnapping of Christian clerics in Nigeria is alarming. This has to be stopped at all cost,” the statement reads. “The Christian community must rise up and come together to put to an end this insult. They should take up arms and defend themselves legitimately. “Nigeria is becoming a killing field where Christian clerics and its members are slaughtered like chicken.” The CAN youth chairperson commiserated with the Niger Christian community and the Catholic diocese of Minna. He, however, called on the government to take control of the situation to avoid future occurrences.
