Dan Nwanyanwu, the presidential candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), says if elected, he will ensure petrol sells at N100 per litre within six months in office. Appearing on Channels TV on Wednesday, Nwanyanwu said all the country’s refineries would be put into operation within four months. He said his government would ensure refineries are built in every geo-political zone. “Somebody that is involved in oil bunkering will not allow the refineries to work. He will want fuel to be sold at N1,000 per litre,” Nwanyanwu said. “Read my lips and take it to the bank, within six months, I will sell fuel for N100 in this country. I have calculated it. All these refineries will be put to use within three or four months. “At the same time – simultaneously – we are going to install modern refineries in each geopolitical zone. This thing will disappear – this idea of subsidy and all that is created. What are we subsidising?” “What happened to the others, including your gear oil and all those? They take it away. You don’t talk about it. I won’t let that happen under my nose. These, my colleagues, most of them are involved in these deals. They cannot do it. “That is why when I told you I have no encumbrances, I have nothing attached to me in relation to the perennial problems we are passing [through] today. I will get it done. Dan Nwanyanwu will get it done as commander-in-chief.”
