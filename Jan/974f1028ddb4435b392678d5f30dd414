Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) does not mean well for Nigerians. Tinubu spoke on Wednesday at a rally that was held at the Sani Abacha stadium in Kano state. The former governor of Lagos said while he and his party can make Nigeria better, the other parties and their candidates cannot. “We can make Nigeria better, safer, and more prosperous. We can educate our youths, feed our people, and put an end to fear. We can do these things. We can move you forward,” he said. “But the others cannot. They want to hold you back so that only they can move forward. They offer nothing but fake promises and easy answers that hold no water. All they can show you is how to hate your fellow Nigerian and reject your neighbour. “But they cannot show you how to protect our society, feed our people, provide jobs and care for those in true need of help. “Let me say this clearly and plainly. This campaign is about our collective march to a better Nigeria. Do we march forward? Or do we lose sight of the road? “We must march forward. But we cannot forget how they frittered away our commonwealth. For 16 years, they toyed with our lives and the future of this country. They spent $16 billion on electricity, but they procured darkness instead.” Tinubu also said the PDP and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, do not fulfill promises. “Neither he nor his party can keep their promise. Tell me how they will keep their promise to the nation,” Tinubu said. “No wonder, their party is in tatters! Governor Wike was right when he talked about a lack of integrity, saying ‘look at the man and his history’. Their contribution to institutional-building is to create an electoral commission to rig elections.” The APC candidate added that his policies would revive the industries in Kano.
