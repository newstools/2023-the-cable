Atiku Abubakar, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, on Saturday, experienced a slip of the tongue during the party’s campaign rally in Kogi state. At the rally held at the confluence stadium in Lokoja, the Kogi capital, Abubakar asked the party supporters to “vote APC…”, before correcting himself and saying PDP. “People of Kogi state, we are here not to deceive you. We are men and women of integrity. I want to appeal to you that if you want your next state government to benefit you, vote APC… PDP in the presidential election,” he said. “You will see that by the time we come to conduct the governorship election, we will take over Kogi state and make sure we deliver good governance to all of you.” The development comes weeks after Abubakar made a similar gaffe during the party’s campaign rally at the Rwang Pam Township Stadium in Jos, the Plateau capital. While concluding his speech in Hausa, the PDP presidential candidate had said: “For God’s sake and for the value of this place, ensure that you vote for A… I mean PDP this time around”. Abubakar, who had earlier defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC), rejoined the PDP in December 2017. See video below.
