President Muhammadu Buhari has urged diplomats posted to the country ahead of the elections to keep their activities professional. Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson, said Buhari gave the warning on Thursday while receiving letters of credence from ambassadors of Switzerland, Sweden, Republic of Ireland, Kingdom of Thailand, Republic of Senegal, and Republic of South Sudan. Buhari asked the diplomats not to meddle in the nation’s politics and focus on their objectives for being in the country. “I urge you to be guided by diplomatic practice to ensure that your activities remain within the limits of your profession as you monitor the build-up to the elections and the conduct of the general election itself,” Buhari said. ‘‘I wish you all success in your respective tours of duty and at the same time encourage you to take time to enjoy the unique nature and culture at your disposal as you travel across our country. “I am therefore confident that your appointments are obviously deliberate to build on the successes of your immediate predecessors in order to advance our relations to significant and enviable heights. “As you settle down to your diplomatic responsibilities, I am hopeful that you will appreciate the political, socio-economic, and cultural diversities, which are the hallmarks of the Nigerian nation. The president also sought cooperation and collaboration from the countries to overcome the challenges facing the country. ‘‘Sectors such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, local manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, agribusiness, transportation, and solid minerals are areas of particular interest to us and foreign investors alike,” he said. “This will enable us to collectively strive to resuscitate all our countries’ economies in the post-pandemic global recovery processes.”
