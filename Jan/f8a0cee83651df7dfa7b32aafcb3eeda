The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) says President Muhammadu Buhari should order the release of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in the interest of national security. In October, the court of appeal in Abuja struck out the terrorism charge filed against Kanu. The appellate court held that Kanu’s extradition from Kenya to Nigeria to stand trial was illegal. The government is yet to release the IPOB leader and it has filed an appeal before the supreme court, as well as an amended charge before the federal high court. Speaking on Wednesday at a media briefing in Imo, Ikenga Ugochinyere, spokesperson of CUPP, said the president has the power to order the discontinuance of the case. “I got off the phone with the lawyer to Mazi Nnamdi Kanu where his deteriorating health condition was brought to my notice,” Ugochinyere said. “I want to urge Mr president in the interest of peace and security to order the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. “There are several court judgments which have declared his continued detention illegal. Mr President has the constitutional power, through the attorney-general of the federation, to order for the discontinuance of the matter. “Kanu should be released, then we can come to the negotiation table and address those issues that led to the agitation.” The CUPP spokesperson also said residents of Imo should vote out the state lawmakers over the state assembly’s alleged refusal to support LGAs autonomy. “How could these set of lawmakers vote against their own freedom and independence? Voting against parliamentary autonomy, LG autonomy, and judicial autonomy is the height of legislative irresponsibility,” he said. “This is unthinkable and unacceptable. Voters must rise up with their votes and tell these jokers that there is a huge price to pay for taking the people for granted.”
