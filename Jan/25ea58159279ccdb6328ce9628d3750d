Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue state, has asked security agencies to do more in tackling insecurity in 2023. In a statement signed by Nathaniel Ikyur, his chief press secretary, Ortom also called on Nigerians to join hands in dealing with insecurity. Ortom expressed hope for an egalitarian society where every citizen is free to ply his or her trade according to the dictates of the law in any part of the country without fear of molestation or intimidation. He said nation-building can be realised “if we consciously participate in the electoral process to elect credible leaders into various offices in 2023”. The Benue governor said it has become imperative that citizens refrain from mundane issues of religious or ethnic biases. He urged the federal government to strive to address issues of insecurity threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria objectively in a manner that gives everyone hope and comfort. He decried the security situation in 2022 and tasked security agents to do more to arrest the deteriorating situation. “Enough is enough. Never again should Nigeria be left in the hands of terrorists in 2023 and beyond for the benefit of generations yet unborn,” he said. On what his administration has done to ensure security in Benue, Ortom said his government has strengthened the community volunteer guards and livestock guards with more vehicles and motorcycles to complement the services of the conventional security agencies to contain the activities of terrorists and criminals in the state. He urged the people of the state to always cooperate with security agencies by providing useful information and all necessary assistance that would facilitate their operations, saying, “security agencies cannot do it alone except citizens complement their untiring efforts”. Ortom wished Nigerians a peaceful and prosperous new year “that promises prosperity of the people in spite of the security and economic challenges facing the nation”.
