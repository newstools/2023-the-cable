The New Year message of President Muhammadu Buhari dominated the cover pages of Nigerian newspapers. Sunday Punch reports that there are indications that organised labour may meet with both the federal and state governments over plans to increase workersâ€™ allowances in a bid to make salaries reflect the rising cost of living. The Nation says Buhari has promised that those planning to disrupt the 2023 general election will be met with the full force of the law. The newspaper reports that Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has dismissed media reports that he had an alleged secret meeting in London with the G5 governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The Guardian reports that Buhari said he has tried his best to serve Nigeria as president. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has disclosed that 460,643 permanent voter cards are yet to be collected in the federal capital territory, the newspaper says. Sunday Sun reports that Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, has responded to critics, saying God does not give power to the wicked. The newspaper says northern stakeholders are divided on which presidential candidate to support for the 2023 elections. Daily Trust says at least 148 civilians were killed by law enforcement agents over the last two years across Nigeria. The newspaper reports that Ignatius Kaigama, Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, has asked Nigerians to be guided by their heads and hearts and not their stomachs and pockets.
