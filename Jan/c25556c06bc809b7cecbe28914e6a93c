Two people have been killed in an accident involving a tanker and three tricycles, popularly known as ‘keke napep’, around the Ikotun area of Lagos. The accident happened around 12:30pm on Tuesday. In a statement, Adebayo Taofiq, director of public affairs of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), said the tanker had brake failure and ran into the tricycles. The driver of one of the tricycles and a passenger were confirmed dead, while four persons — including two pregnant women and two children — were rescued. “LASTMA personnel immediately handed over those rescued victims to policemen from Ikotun police station who took them to General Hospital for treatment,” the statement reads. “A preliminary investigation revealed that the fully loaded container truck (JJJ 125) had a brake failure and crushed three tricycles by a valley around the synagogue when going towards Ikotun. “The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) immediately moved the tanker with those crushed tricycles to Ikotun police station. “Other emergency responders, including police officers from Ikotun police station, were at the scene of the accident. “The general manager of LASTMA, Bolaji Oreagba, however, warned tanker owners and drivers to always ensure that their trucks are properly checked and in good condition before embarking on any journey.” This is the third accident involving heavy-duty vehicles in Lagos state. On Sunday, nine persons lost their lives when a container-laden truck fell on a commercial bus on Ojuelegba bridge. On Monday, a 40-feet container-laden truck fell on the road along the Dopemu area of the state.
