Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun state, has declared January 24 and 25 as work-free days to allow civil servants in the state to collect their permanent voter cards (PVCs). According to NAN, Kunle Somorin, chief press secretary to the governor, announced this in a statement on Sunday. Somorin said the work-free days were declared following the extension of PVCs collection till January 29 by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). He added that since voting is a civic responsibility, all eligible citizens must be allowed to exercise their rights to choose who governs them. “Dapo Abiodun has graciously approved Tuesday, 24, and Wednesday 25 as work-free days to enable public servants to collect their PVCs from their respective local governments,” Somorin said. “The governor enjoined executive members of public markets and private establishments to allow flexibility in their schedules, for residents to use the opportunity to visit INEC offices or collection centres where they registered to collect their PVCs.” Cross River, Lagos and Ekiti state governments had also declared work-free days for PVC collection which began on December 12 and is scheduled to end on January 29.
