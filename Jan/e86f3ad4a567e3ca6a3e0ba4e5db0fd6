Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, has mocked Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), over former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s endorsement of Peter Obi. Atiku was vice-president under Obasanjo from 1999 to 2007. On Sunday, Obasanjo, in a letter to Nigerians, declared his support for Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), ahead of the 2023 general election. He advised Nigerians not to be “confused nor gullible” about who to vote for, adding that Obi has what it takes to put Nigeria on the right path to progress. Speaking on Monday at the flag-off ceremony of the construction of a road in Emohua LGA of the state, Wike said there is “something fundamentally wrong” if Abubakar could not get the support of the former president. “I worked with somebody for eight years and we are using it as a campaign that when we were in office we did well. Then my boss is recommending another person, not me? Something is fundamentally wrong,” Wike said. “Go and hold your boss who recommended another person other than you. “I was praying that Obasanjo should not say anything. When I saw the letter last night, I was touched. If your principal cannot recommend you, then there is something fundamentally wrong. “After all, you people went to lobby your principal to recommend you. It took your principal a long time — but he wrote a letter to all Nigerians (to support another candidate).” Wike also denied allegations that he influenced the PDP zoning committee which was chaired by Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, not to zone the PDP presidential ticket to the south.
