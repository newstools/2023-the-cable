The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has warned Nigerians against two substandard cough syrups identified in Uzbekistan. In a statement on Monday, NAFDAC identified the products as Ambronol syrup and DOK-1 Max syrup. The agency said the syrups were manufactured by Marion Biotech, India, adding that the manufacturer has not provided guarantees to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the safety and quality of the products. It said laboratory analysis of samples of both products carried out by Uzbekistan’s ministry of health, found the syrups contained unacceptable amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol. “Diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol are toxic to humans when consumed and can prove fatal. Toxic effects can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental state, and acute kidney injury which may lead to death,” the statement reads. “These substandard products are therefore unsafe and their use, especially in children, may result in serious injury or death. “NAFDAC implores manufacturers of liquid dosage forms, especially syrups that contain excipients including propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, and/or glycerin /glycerol, to test for the presence of contaminants such as ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol before use in medicines. “Although the products are not in the NAFDAC database, importers, distributors, retailers, and consumers are advised to exercise caution and vigilance within the supply chain to avoid the importation, distribution, sale, and use of the substandard (contaminated) syrups. All medical products must be obtained from authorised/licensed suppliers. The products’ authenticity and physical condition should be carefully checked. “Members of the public in possession of the above-listed products are advised to discontinue sale or use and submit stock to the nearest NAFDAC office.”
