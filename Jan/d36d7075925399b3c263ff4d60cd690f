Muhammadu Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto, has told Nigerians to avoid ethnic and religious bias when choosing who to vote for in the general election. Abubakar spoke on Thursday while addressing participants at the 29th regular meeting of the national council on water resources (NCWR) in Sokoto. The sultan said Nigerians need to use their votes wisely during the elections, and urged the electorate to vote for leaders with reputable character. “Nigerians need to think and rethink who they are casting their votes for,” he said. “We should not consider the religious or ethnic backgrounds of anybody we are voting for, but Nigeria first. “Our country should be our priority above anything and not voting any person who may worsen our present challenges.” Abubakar added that for Nigeria to progress as a nation, citizens need to put ethnicity aside and face reality. “Our country is far better than many countries of the world in terms of security,” he added. “Therefore, we should continue to support and appreciate our country and leaders with prayers in order to be able to address our challenges.”
