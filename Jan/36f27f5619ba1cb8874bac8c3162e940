Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto, has condemned the attack on his convoy by suspected thugs. On Sunday, suspected thugs hurled stones at some of the cars in Tambuwal’s convoy in Wammako LGA of the state. The governor and some PDP chieftains were returning from a campaign tour of Silame and Wammako LGAs when the incident happened. Windscreens and windows of some of the cars in the convoy were destroyed during the incident. However, no casualty was recorded. Speaking after a stakeholders’ meeting on Monday, Tambuwal said some of the attackers have been arrested. The Sokoto governor also urged supporters of political parties not to perpetrate violence. “The matter is being investigated by the security agencies. Some arrests have been made. Rest assured that the law will take its course,” the governor said according to a statement by Muhammad Bello, his media aide. “It is unfortunate that yesterday on our way back from Wammako, at the Senatorial office of Aliyu Magatakarda Wammako, some hoodlums attacked my convoy on our way to the government house. “We cannot condone any culture of violence in Sokoto state.” Also speaking, Akibu Dalhatu, the state’s commissioner for information, said one Abu Mai Adda, identified as the alleged mastermind of the attack, has been arrested. Dalhatu said the suspect is also on the watchlist of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) for allegedly attacking an officer.
