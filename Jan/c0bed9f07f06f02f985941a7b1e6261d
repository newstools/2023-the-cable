The Rivers police command says it has uncovered two “baby factories” in Igwuruta and Omagwa communities in the state. According to a statement on Tuesday, Grace Iringe-Koko, police spokesperson in the state, said the operatives rescued 10 pregnant females. Iringe-Koko said the pregnant persons were between the ages of 15 and 29. The police spokesperson said the victims alleged that the suspects tricked them into selling their children in exchange for the sum of N500,000. Iringe-Koko said the operatives arrested four suspects, including two males and two females. She also said one Peace Aliko, identified as a 40-year-old woman from Iguruta community, suspected to be the owner of the houses, was also apprehended. “After the victims have been put to bed, the suspect leader will keep the baby with her while she pays the mother a sum of five hundred thousand naira (N500,000),” the statement reads. “All of the suspects admitted to participating in the dirty game to meet their financial needs.” The police spokesperson said the operatives recovered a white Honda Pilot Jeep with registration number, Lagos, FST 607 AX, from the suspects. Iringe-Koko, however, added that the command is making efforts to arrest persons who bought the babies.
