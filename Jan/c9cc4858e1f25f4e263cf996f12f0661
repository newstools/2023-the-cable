According to a statement signed by Lawal Tanko, spokesperson to the SSG, “Ahmed Matane told most Rev. Uzoukwu that the government will collaborate with the Catholic Diocese of Minna and other organisations in finding a lasting solution to insecurity which has become a major threat to lives and property of the citizenry in the state.” “On behalf of the people and government of the state, the SSG prayed God to have mercy on the soul of the deceased, give his immediate family, members of the Catholic Diocese of Minna, and the Christian community in the State the fortitude to bear the loss.” The SSG was accompanied by Yusuf Liman, commissioner for youth and sports development;  Emmanuel Musa, commissioner of information and strategy; Emmanuel Umar, commissioner for internal security;  Akilu Musa, permanent secretary, ministry of finance;  Abubakar Mohammed, director-general of religious affairs and the chairman of Paikoro LGA.
