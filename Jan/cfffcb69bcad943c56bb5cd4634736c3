Victor Osimhen scored the opener as Napoli defeated AS Roma 2-1 in their Serie A clash at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Sunday. The Partenopeans continued their impressive run at the top of the league to establish a 13-point gap above the chasing pack. Osimhen put Napoli ahead in the 17th minute after a tidy cross-in from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. The Nigerian cushioned the ball on his chest and redirected it with the thigh before smashing a shot into the roof of the net beyond Rui Patricio. The Nigerian got his 14th league goal of the season, adding to his comfort at the summit of Serie A’s goal scorers. Although Stephan El Sharaawy equalised for Roma, Gio Simeone secured Napoli’s victory with a late winner in the 82nd minute.  On the other side of Italy, Ademola Lookman scored a classy individual goal as Atalanta defeated Sampdoria 2-0 in Serie A. Lookman slalomed past two defenders to finish with a powerful low shot to double the score at the Gewiss Stadium. The goal is his 12th goal of the season, second only behind Osimhen in the Serie A golden boot race. Also, David Okereke scored the opener for Cremonese in their 2-1 loss to Inter Milan.  In England, Kelechi Iheanacho was the matchwinner for Leceister City as they overcame Walsall 1-0 to advance into the next round of the FA Cup. The Nigerian came on to make the difference in the 69th minute with a deflected shot from outside the area. Iheanacho has now scored 17 goals in the FA Cup — the highest for an African player. In Portugal, Zaidu Sanusi returned from injury to help FC Porto lift the Portuguese League Cup. He was subbed on with eleven minutes left to be played in the victory over Sporting Lisbon in the final. The 25-year-old had not featured for Porto since he picked up an injury in the Champions League game against Atlético Madrid on November 1. Photo credit: Reuters
