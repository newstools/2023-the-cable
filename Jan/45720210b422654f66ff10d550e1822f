Frank Lampard has been sacked by Everton following a poor run of form that left the club on the 19th spot in the English Premier League (EPL) table. According to SkySport, the former English midfielder was shown the exit doors at Goodison Park on Monday — a few days after Everton’s 2-0 loss to West Ham in the EPL. The loss to West Ham is the 10th consecutive match that Everton has played in all competition without a win this season. Everton languish in the relegation zone with 15 points from 20 matches, above only Southampton on goal difference. Lampard could only marshall Everton to three wins all season. The 44-year-old was appointed as manager for the Merseyside club in January 2022, as a replacement for Rafael Benitez. He helped the club avoid relegation by whiskers last season — finishing with paltry four points above the drop zone. Lampard was the club’s fifth permanent manager in five years. The dismissal comes after Everton fans had protested against the club’s hierarchy which prompted a rare visit to the club’s game by Farhad Moshiri, its owner, and an impromptu meeting by the board of directors on Sunday.
