Festus Keyamo, spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council, has described Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), as the “greatest weapon” of the ruling party to retain power. Keyamo spoke in a chat with Arise TV on Wednesday. The minister of state for labour and employment said Obi’s movement has turned the election into “a one-horse race” in favour of APC. He added that the LP candidate has taken a significant support structure of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with him, causing “mounting problems” for the party. “The truth of the matter is that this election appears to be over already. It is a one-horse race. I am not hyping our candidate because I am the spokesperson but any close watcher of events should know by now so the result will not shock anybody when it drops,” he said. “The problems are mounting for the PDP. Both in and out of the party. Every person who supported PDP against us in 2019 [has left]. “Ohaneze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum, PANDEF, Afenifere, Obasanjo and Ayo Adebanjo all endorsed Atiku in 2019. But now, they have pulled out. They are supporting Labour Party. “We said Peter Obi is the greatest weapon that Asiwaju has. Obi is the biggest reason Asiwaju will win this election.”
