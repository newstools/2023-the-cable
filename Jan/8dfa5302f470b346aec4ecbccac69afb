Thirty-nine passengers sustained injuries on Tuesday when a truck rammed into a bus in Onitsha area of Anambra state. Adeoye Irelewuyi, sector commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Anambra, confirmed the incident in a statement. Irelewuyi, who said the accident occurred around 11:30am on the Onitsha-Enugu expressway, added that an eyewitness said the truck had no registration number and speeding before it lost control and crashed into a Mercedes 608 bus with registration number ENU355 UJ. “The bus somersaulted and crashed. Forty-two persons, comprising 18 male adults and 24 female adults, were in the bus,” he said. “Fifteen male adults and 24 female adults sustained varying degrees of injury and were rushed to Amaku Teaching Hospital by FRSC rescue team from RS5.3 Awka for medical treatment.” Irelewuyi, however, said no fatality was recorded but the incident resulted in gridlock. Corps personnel from Awka command were said to be on the ground to manage the traffic situation and to ensure the removal of the wreckage from the road. He also warned motorists to desist from speeding and cultivate a new driving culture to ensure safety on the nation’s highways.
