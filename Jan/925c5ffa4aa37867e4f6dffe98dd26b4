Abiodun Alabi, the commissioner of police (CP) in Lagos, has ordered the replacement of all officers attached to Ajiwe station in Ajah area of the state. Alabi also ordered that all shanties located around the Ajah police division be removed.

The shooting incident occurred at the Ajah axis of Lagos. The incident sparked widespread criticism, while the Lagos state government filed a one-count charge of unlawful killing against Vandi. Subsequently, the officer was remanded at the Ikoyi correctional centre pending legal advice from the state directorate of public prosecution (DPP). Vandi has also been suspended by the Police Service Commission (PSC). Also, on December 6, a police inspector attached to the same station allegedly shot dead Gafaru Buraimoh, a resident of Happy Land estate in Ajah.
