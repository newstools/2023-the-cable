The federal government has finalised the registration process of the Congress of University Academics (CONUA), a breakaway faction of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). On Tuesday, the leadership of the union held a closed-door meeting with Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, in Abuja. At the meeting, the minister presented the certificate of registration, official gazette, and Trade Dispute Act to the union led by Niyi Sunmonu, its national coordinator. Addressing journalists after the closed-door meeting, Ngige enjoined the faction not to “behave like ASUU”. The minister also assured the union of government’s support to operate effectively across universities in the country. Sunmonu confirmed the meeting to TheCable. “Yes, we met with the minister (Ngige) today. There was a presentation of certificate of registration to CONUA. This means the registration of our union has been finalised by the government,” he said. He added that CONUA will hold its national executive council (NEC) meeting over the weekend to discuss issues affecting the union. CONUA was officially registered in October 2022. Its registration came amid the eight-month strike embarked upon by ASUU. Lecturers under ASUU have been at loggerheads with the government since the strike ended, over non-payment of their salaries for the period the industrial action lasted.
