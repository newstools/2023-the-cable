Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says “a new Nigeria is possible” if the party is voted into office in the 2023 general election. Obi said this on Monday during his party’s presidential campaign rally in Warri, Delta state. The LP candidate also urged residents of the state to consider character and competence before voting in the coming election. “A new Nigeria is possible. All of you will be part of it. Don’t listen to them. They’ve been here for a long time;  they’ve not done anything for anybody,” Obi said. “Go out and vote for me and Datti. I assure you I will not be in Abuja; I will visit here as president. When I come back, you will be proud that you voted somebody who is going to care about you; that is what we want. “Go out and vote Labour all the way. Stay there; vote, convince your neighbours.” Also present at the LP presidential campaign rally were Datti Baba-Ahmed, LP vice-presidential candidate; Julius Abure, LP national chairperson; and Pat Utomi, a chieftain of the party.
