Germany will now require a COVID test for people entering the country from China. Announcing this on Thursday, Karl Lauterbach, the health minister, said Germany would require “at least a rapid test” taken shortly before departure. According to Reuters, he said random checks upon entry would also be carried out “to recognise virus variants”. “Europe has found a joint response to the pandemic situation in China. This is precisely what we as the federal government have been working towards,” he said. The steps are in line with recommendations by EU government officials on Wednesday. The officials resolved that in addition to passengers testing negative for COVID-19 before travelling, they should also be made to wear face masks on flights to and from China. Several countries, including the UK, Spain, France, Italy, and the United States, have imposed mandatory COVID tests on travellers arriving from China following a surge in cases in the country. Reacting, China called the restrictions “unscientific” and threatened to impose countermeasures. “We are willing to strengthen communication with the international community and work hard together to overcome the pandemic,” Mao Ning, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said. “At the same time, we also believe that some countries have imposed entry restrictions targeting only Chinese travellers. This lacks scientific basis and some practices are unacceptable. “We firmly oppose any attempt to manipulate epidemic prevention measures in order to achieve political goals. We will take countermeasures based on the principle of reciprocity.”
