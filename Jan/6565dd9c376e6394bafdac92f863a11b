The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has expressed its dismay at the “silence” of the federal government and President Muhammadu Buhari over an airstrike that killed over 40 herders. Last week, the herders and an unspecified number of livestock were killed in Doma LGA of Nasarawa state. Baba Othman Ngelzarma, MACBAN president, had said the herders were killed when they went to get 1,250 of their cows impounded by the Benue livestock guards. In a statement on Sunday, Muhammad Abdullahi, MACBAN spokesperson, said the killings constitute “war crimes” and an inquiry must be instituted to find out how the explosion came about. “If nothing, we expect the President to commiserate with families of the victims for this heinous crime,” the spokesperson said. “MACBAN holds the Benue government liable because from all indications, the trucks carrying the livestock were closely monitored until they reached destination before an armed drone was unleashed on pastoralists. “The late pastoralists are bona fide Nigerians, have rights like every other citizen and therefore must be protected under the law. The loss of one life is bad enough to talk less of over 40 innocent lives in a single swoop. This is unacceptable and the most despicable crime against humanity. “We find it shameful that while people were being killed, the president was enjoying a state dinner in Katsina state. “We also call on the National Human Rights Commission to investigate this case and other cases involving shootings by the Air Force in Nasarawa.”
