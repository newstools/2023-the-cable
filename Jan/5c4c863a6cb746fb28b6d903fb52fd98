Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos has approved four days of work free for public servants to obtain their permanent voter cards (PVCs). The approval was contained in a circular released by Hakeem Muri-Okunola, the state’s head of service on Wednesday. He said this will commence on Tuesday, January 24, and end on Friday, January 27, for different grade levels of workers. “Consequent upon the extension of the collection of permanent voters cards by the Independent National Electoral Commission, it is hereby notified for the general information that all public servants who are yet to collect their permanent voter cards from designated INEC centres are encouraged to do so before Sunday, January 29, 2023, as it is a civic responsibility to vote,” the circular reads. “To this end, Mr governor has graciously approved a work-free day to enable public servants to collect their PVCs from their respective local government/local council development areas as presented in the table below.” “The dates include Tuesday, January 24, 2023, for grade levels 01, 03, 07, and 15; Wednesday, January 25, 2023, for grade levels 02, 04, 08, and 13; Thursday, January 26, 2023, for grade levels 05, 09, 12, and 17; and Friday, January 27, 2023, for grade levels 06, 10, 14 and 16. “Consequently, accounting officers and all public servants are to ensure compliance whilst giving this circular the service-wide publicity it deserves.” Lagos joins other states like Borno which also declared work-free days for civil servants to collect their PVCs. Meanwhile, INEC has extended the deadline for the collection of permanent voter cards till January 29. The commission had initially fixed December 12 to January 22 for the exercise in all the 774 LGAs.
