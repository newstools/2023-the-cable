Victor Osimhen, Super Eagles of Nigeria striker, was one of the best performers with two goals and an assist as Napoli trashed Juventus 5-1 in their Serie A match at the Diego Maradona Stadium on Friday night. In the match that pitted the top two sides in the league, it was Napoli that cemented their top status as Osimhen scored once in each half and tormented the Juventus defence all night in the big win. The 24-year-old was on hand to finish off the rebound from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s saved shot with a well-placed header to give Napoli the lead in 14 minutes. He then provided the assist for Kvaratskhelia’s goal, serving the ball on a plate for the electric playmaker who had a hand in four goals to slot into the bottom far corner for 2-0. Despite Juventus pulling one back before halftime through Angel Di Maria, Luciano Spalletti’s men regained the two-goal cushion before Osimhen increased the margin with another well-placed header to make it 4-1. The brace means Osimhen has scored 12 goals in Serie A this season and remains the leading marksman, with four goals ahead of his closest competition. Napoli’s big win puts them ten points ahead of second-placed Juventus in the race for the Scudetto title with 47 points after 18 matches.
