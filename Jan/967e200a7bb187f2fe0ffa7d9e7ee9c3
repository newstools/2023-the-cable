The New Nigeria Political Party (NNPP) presidential campaign council says Rabiu Kwankwaso, its presidential candidate, has a clear strategy to win the forthcoming elections. In a statement issued on Sunday, Ladipo Johnson, spokesperson of the campaign council, said the party’s presidential campaign is waxing stronger. “RMK 2023 campaign is waxing stronger, as we head into the last 30 days of the campaign,” Johnson said. “Our candidate has reached over 400 local governments and he is going into the only state he has not been to, to campaign in the coming days. “We repeat that we have a clear strategic path to victory and that, by God’s special grace, NNPP and Kwankwaso are going to win the election.” He also condemned the “campaign of calumny being orchestrated by those who have failed the country”. “Ab initio, they initiated and carried rumours about Kwankwaso purportedly stepping down for their weak candidates,” he said. “These political jobbers are attempting to push their narratives by using pecuniary means to entice solitary NNPP or Kwankwasiyya members. “They then staged decamping shows where they paraded a few hired hands adorned with new red Kwankwasiyya caps, which they symbolically removed or threw away. “These people are jokers and should be seen as such.” Johnson said “expired politicians” would continue to seek to buy the loyalty and votes of Nigerians. He added that Kwankwaso has the competence, capacity and political will to move Nigeria in the right direction.
