The Northern States Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) says no Nigerian should be disenfranchised because of security challenges. In a statement on Tuesday, Ejoga Inalegu, chairman of the forum, expressed dismay that despite efforts of the law enforcement agencies, the security situation across the country is “worsening”. “With the improved surveillance and deterrent measures being taken by the security forces in tackling insecurity, we are surprised at the deteriorating situation arising in these areas,” Inalegu said. “We call on the governments at the state and federal levels to give the security forces the needed support to sustain the push against the insurgency plaguing the nation, especially as we approach the 2023 elections, so that no section of the country is disenfranchised on grounds of insecurity. “We were excited when politicians were able to make night visits to areas of hitherto high insecurity only to at the same time be greeted with sustained attacks against communities in southern Kaduna at about the same time.” The chairman asked Nigerians to reject politicians who have “resorted to divisive politics of exclusion”. “Reject those who believe that winning an election is more important than the harmonious existence of the nation. Remember that the massive money they are using to buy and make people compromise their conscience is our money,” he said. “Whether you collect or don’t collect their ill-gotten money, be prepared to vote out those propagating politics of exclusion and make it unattractive for the future.”
