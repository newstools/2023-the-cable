In China, there is Kung Fu martial arts. In northern Nigeria, it is called Dambe, a traditional martial art that started in the olden days to prepare men for war. It has now become one of the most celebrated sports activities in the region. Dambe is usually accompanied by drumming and other ceremonious activities. Each participant or boxer is allowed to make use of one leg which is also called the lead leg, which has clothes taped around it. That leg can be used for both offense and defense while the unwrapped leg can be used for kicks. One hand, which is referred to as the “spear”, is wrapped with a piece of cloth; while the other hand called the “shield” is unwrapped and can be used to grab and hold an opponent. Dambe has received much attention from boxers who travel to the region to witness and participate in the event. Preparing for the fight A Dambe fighter There are three rounds in this game. Unlike other sports, there is no time limit in this one. Instead, they end when:
1) There is no activity again.
2) One of the participants or an official calls a halt.
