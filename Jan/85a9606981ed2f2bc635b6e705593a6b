Police operatives have arrested three men found with 41 children along the Okolowo expressway in Kwara state. According to a statement by Ajayi Okasanmi, spokesperson of the Kwara police command, the suspects and the children were intercepted around 4am on Saturday. The police said efforts are ongoing to reach the parents of the children, while operatives are also investigating the claim by the suspects that the children were on their way to be enrolled in a school in Kwara. “On January 14, 2023, at 0400 hours along the Okolowo Expressway, a detachment of policemen on special security assignment intercepted the trio of Musa Ayuba, 44, Jeremiah Muda, 35, and Luka Ayuba, 37, all of Bangi village via Kontagora, Niger State, with 41 young boys and girls (22 boys and 19 girls) with their age ranges between five and 15 years, while waiting for a lorry that was to convey them to their destination in Ilorin,” the statement reads. “The suspects, while undergoing interrogation, claimed to be coming from Niger State to Ilorin to meet a certain pastor to enroll the children in a yet-to-be-determined school. “The claim that looked spurious would be discreetly investigated, as it is highly suspected to be a case of child trafficking. “The children are presently in the custody of the police command, with efforts to contact the state ministry of women’s affairs. “Investigation and contact with the children’s parents and guardians are ongoing.”
