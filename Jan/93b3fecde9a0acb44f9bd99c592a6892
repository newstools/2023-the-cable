The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has condoled the Catholic Church over the killing of Isaac Achi, a priest of St. Peters and Paul Catholic Church in Kafin-Koro, Paikoro LGA of Niger. Last week, Achi was burnt to death at about 3 am after terrorists invaded his residence. They reportedly razed the building after failing to gain access. The priest was buried on Friday. In a statement on Sunday, Daniel Okoh, president of CAN, said the authorities must improve the country’s internal and external security framework to forestall any future occurrence. “His death is a sad development at a time his parishioners and by extension, other Christians in the country can benefit more from his leadership and sense of direction,” Okoh said. “It is a big loss to the church in which he played major roles as priest, guardian, and philanthropist to many needy members of our society. Because of these impeccable records, he lives in our hearts. “His indelible footprints tell us that he will always be part of the journey of many believers in Nigeria and the world at large. “As we condole with the entire Catholic Church at this moment of grief, CAN appeals to the authorities to improve our internal and external security framework to stop future occurrences of such incidents that led to Fr. Achi’s sudden demise.”
