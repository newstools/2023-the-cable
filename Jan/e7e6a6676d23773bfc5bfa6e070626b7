Gunmen have killed Christian Ihim, an aide of Emma Ibediro, a former national organising secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The gunmen were said to have stormed Ihim’s residence in Umuchoke Okwe in Onuimo LGA of Imo in the early hours of Tuesday. A resident of the community told TheCable that his wife and children were spared. “He is an aide to the former Organising Secretary of APC, Hon. Barr. Emma Ibediro, who is also from Okwe. He slept with his family in his house but they shot him dead leaving his wife as children,” the resident said. “I am from Okwe and I slept in the village that night. We came out in the morning to hear that another man fell on his tiles on hearing the close gunshots and broke his head. The man died this morning in the hospital. “There is a problem in the land. People are killed everyday like fowls. Onuimo has been deserted because of fear. Government should do something fast about the situation.” On Monday, gunmen killed Chris Ohizu, chairman of Ideato north LGA, after collecting N6 million ransom from his family. The police in Imo are yet to comment on the development.
