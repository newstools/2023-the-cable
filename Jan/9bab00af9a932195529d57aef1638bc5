Khadija Okunnu-Lamidi, a former presidential hopeful of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), has been appointed as the deputy director-general of the party’s presidential campaign council. Okunnu-Lamidi’s appointment was announced in a statement signed by Olu Agunloye, SDP national secretary, on Tuesday. She was the first female to declare interest to run for the office of the president in the 2023 general election. She lost the SDP presidential primary election to Adewole Adebayo, founder of KAFTAN Television, who polled 1,526 while she got 83 votes. Agunloye said Okunnu-Lamidi’s appointment is to enable effective engagement with the people, adding that it will help in ensuring success, justice as well as peace and development of the party. Commenting on her appointment, Okunnu-Lamidi promised to work actively to implement the plans of the party and ensure that vulnerable people are protected. “I am immensely grateful for the high confidence the national working committee of our great SDP demonstrated in me with this critical appointment as deputy DG of our winning presidential campaign,” she said. “I am honoured by the opportunity to serve our nation and the SDP in the mission to reinstate the honour of our peoples and the seemingly elusive promise of our nationhood. “I believe in Nigeria, in the drive and energy of our people, their sterling character and unbreakable resilience, their faith in themselves and in the unlimited talents with which the Almighty has endowed us. “I join this campaign to help in correcting the existing state of affairs built to dash the hopes of our people. “I am bound to honour the trust that has been reposed in me with diligence, the same high character and sense of responsibility that is exemplified by our candidate and the next President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria: Prince Adewole Adebayo.”
