Seyi Makinde, governor of Oyo, says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is “treading on a very dangerous path” with the lingering crisis in the party. Makinde is one of the G5 governors of the PDP who have refused to participate in the presidential campaign of Atiku Abubakar, PDP flagbearer. Other G5 governors are Nyesom Wike of Rivers, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu, Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia, and Samuel Ortom of Benue. They have asked Ayu to step down as PDP national chairman as a condition for supporting the party’s presidential campaign In December 2022, Wike announced that the G5 governors will announce their preferred presidential candidate in January. Speaking on Friday with Channels TV, Makinde was asked who is the preferred presidential candidate of the G5 governors. The Oyo governor declined to give a name, saying “one day is a very long time in politics”. “The first election is February 25, that is still little short of four weeks. We (referring to G5 governors) had issues and brought them up,” he added. “We said the constitution of the party is very clear about rotation and zoning. I was the one who brought it up at the NEC meeting. Section 7(3)(c) of the PDP constitution is very clear. “We are treading on a very dangerous path. I will not say because I’m in PDP then I should compromise on my principles and that is what the G5 governors are saying. “The party says the PDP constitution, which invariably says you must zone and rotate party position, should be disregarded and we said no.”
