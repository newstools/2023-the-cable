Political parties in Kwara are to sign a peace accord to ensure an equal playing ground in the upcoming general election. The peace accord will be signed by the parties in the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Ilorin, the Kwara capital. Garba Madami, Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Kwara, said this while delivering a lecture on the need for peaceful elections organised by the state council of veteran journalists. Madami who was said to have conducted a similar successful exercise during the 2019 elections, said it wonâ€™t have happened without peace and an equal playing ground to enable citizens to vote. He said the commission has received more than 57,000 permanent voters cards to be distributed to their owners at various wards for easy collection across the state. The REC further said the media and security agencies are integral partners of the commission in conducting free, credible, and peaceful elections in Nigeria. He advised parents against allowing their children to be used as thugs by politicians to disturb the election process. Madami also assured that the commission will replicate the measures adopted four years ago to ensure political parties and candidates have fair and equal chances at victory during the election. Meanwhile, presidential candidates of some political parties had in September 2022, signed a peace accord to promote peaceful electioneering in the upcoming election.
