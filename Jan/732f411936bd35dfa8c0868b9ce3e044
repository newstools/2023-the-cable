They are setting everything on fire. [Please] help,” he had tweeted. The Imo PDP, in a statement by Collins Opuruozor, its spokesperson, confirmed the attack. “The PDP in Imo State alerts that, at the moment, there is a well-coordinated armed attack going on at the Akokwa residence of Ikenga Ugochinyere, the candidate of our party for Ideato North/South Federal Constituency,” the statement reads. “This has resulted in the killing of undisclosed number of persons. Also, buildings are reported to have been set ablaze. “Our efforts to get back to our candidate, Ugochinyere, who was present at his residence when this attack began and who had personally alerted us to the attack, has proven abortive. ‘However, a torrent of messages, a while ago, from Ikenga’s close aides bore some deeply pathetic lines like: ‘Everywhere is on fire! They are killing us! We are going going!” The party called on security agencies to intervene over the situation.
