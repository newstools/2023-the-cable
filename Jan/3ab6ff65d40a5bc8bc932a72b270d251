President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the senate to confirm the reappointment of seven nominees as board members of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC). The president based his request on section 3(3) and 7 of the corrupt practices and other related offences act. Buhari’s request was contained in a letter read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Tuesday. “In accordance to provisions of section 3(3) and 7 of the corrupt practices and other related offences act, 2000, I write to forward for confirmation by the senate the underlisted names of seven persons for reappointment as members of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC),” he said. “It is my hope that the distinguished senate will consider and confirm the appointments in the usual expeditious manner.” Here are the renominated board members of the ICPC.
