Two children have been burnt to death after a fire gutted their house in Udo Imuk street, Eket LGA of Akwa Ibom. The incident was said to have occurred at about 7pm on Friday. The children, six and three years old, were said to have been locked up in a room by their parents who went out to get things in the neighbourhood. Odiko Macdon, police spokesperson in the state, said the mother of the children locked the room when leaving the house, making it impossible for them to get out. He said the command could not ascertain the source of the fire but has commenced an investigation to ensure such an occurrence is prevented in the future. “Indeed that incident occurred, it was an unfortunate one indeed. It was very unfortunate that the mother left two of her children at home and locked the door, and well, we didn’t know how the fire started but unfortunately, the children couldn’t escape and were consumed in the inferno,” he told TheCable. “The commissioner of police has sent his condolences and the command has extended its investigation to determine the remote cause and try to see how in the future such occurrences or incidences could be prevented. “Indeed, it was an unfortunate one but we are looking at the remote and immediate cause.”
