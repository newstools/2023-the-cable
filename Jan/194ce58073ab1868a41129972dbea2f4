The management of AIT, a Nigerian television station, says Raymond Dokpesi, founder of  Daar Communications, has been released after his delay at Heathrow airport in London. According to media reports, Dokpesi was delayed on Sunday by Immigration after a trip from Frankfurt on a Lufthansa airlines flight that arrived in the UK. “Dokpesi arrived via Frankfurt from Abuja on a Lufthansa airlines flight and was invited off the plane before other passengers were disembarked,” the management of the television station said in a statement on Monday. “Dokpesi was delayed at the airport for some hours before his passport was stamped and he was cleared by British Immigration officials for entry into the country.” The statement added that the Peoples’ Democratic Chieftain (PDP) made the London trip following the invitation of Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the party by the British government to share perspectives on issues around the next month’s presidential election in the country. Dokpesi is the deputy director-general, of the technical and systems of the PDP presidential campaign council. TheCable reached out to the Metropolitan Police Service (Met), in London, on the ‘incident’, but the service said it could not give such information to the public. Morgan, a customer relation officer, who spoke with TheCable, said it was mandatory for her not to release a report of an arrest, adding that she could not categorically confirm the status of the arrest or if it was made. On his part, Debo Ologunagba, the spokesperson of the opposition PDP told TheCable that he didn’t have confirmation of the arrest.
