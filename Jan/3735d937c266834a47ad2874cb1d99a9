Chelsea have completed the signing of Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk for around £88.5 million. The 22-year-old signed an eight-and-a-half-year contract with Chelsea after the Blues hijacked the hot prospect’s signing from Arsenal. The Stamford Bridge side presented the winger during their English Premier League (EPL) match against Crystal Palace. Mudryk becomes Chelsea’s fifth January signing as the club continues to endure a run of poor results that has seen them stuck in mid-table. Speaking with the club’s media department, the wonderkid expressed his joy at joining Chelsea. “I’m so happy to sign for Chelsea,” Mudryk started, “this is a huge club, in a fantastic league and it is a very attractive project for me at this stage of my career,” he said. “I’m excited to meet my new teammates and I’m looking forward to working and learning under Graham Potter and his staff.” The club hierarchy, led by Todd Boehly, Chelsea chairman, and Behdad Eghbali, co-controlling owner, also spoke about their delight at completing the transfer of the “exciting talent”. “We are delighted to welcome Mykhailo to Chelsea. He’s a hugely exciting talent who we believe will be a terrific addition to our squad both now and in the years to come,” they said in a statement. “He will add further depth to our attack and we know he’ll get a very warm welcome to London.” Mudryk joined the Shakhtar Donetsk academy in 2016 and broke into the first team during the 2021/22 season with two goals and seven assists in 11 league games.
