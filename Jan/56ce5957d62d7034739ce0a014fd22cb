The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says the ninth assembly will be remembered as one of the “most clueless” in the nation’s history. Debo Ologunagba, the PDP spokesperson, said this on Wednesday when he featured on Prime Time, a programme on Arise TV. The ninth assembly led by Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives, came into being in 2019 and will end in June 2023 when the 10th assembly is inaugurated. Ologunagba, who was a member of the house of representatives between 2010 and 2015, said the ninth assembly has failed to live up to the expectations of Nigerians. “I am a product of the national assembly. It would not be too comfortable to say things about them. But, however, the ninth assembly will go down in the history to be one of the most clueless and possibly insensitive assemblies for the Nigerian people,” he said. While the ninth assembly has been criticised for being a rubberstamp of the executive arm of government, it has, however, been commended for passing landmark bills which failed in previous assemblies. The legislations include the 2022 Electoral Act Amendment Bill, Petroleum Industry Bill, and the Startup Act. In May 2023, Lawan said the ninth assembly has done “tremendously well” and stands out from the previous assemblies in “critical and crucial legislations for national development”.
