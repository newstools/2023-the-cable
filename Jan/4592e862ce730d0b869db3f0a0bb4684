The Edo government says seven persons, including two village chiefs, have been arrested over the train attack that occurred in the state. On January 7, gunmen kidnapped passengers waiting to board a train at the train station in Igueben LGA of the state, to Warri in Delta state. At least 30 people were reportedly kidnapped, but Chris Nehikhare, the state’s commissioner for communication and orientation, later said an intelligence report showed that 20 persons were abducted. Many of the travellers also sustained injuries from gunshots fired by the attackers. Earlier, the state police command said 18 abductees have been rescued so far. Speaking with journalists on Wednesday, in Benin, the state’s capital, Nehikhare said seven other suspects have also been arrested in connection with the incident. He also said security agents have rescued the two remaining passengers in captivity. “The success story in the kidnapping is that five persons and two village chiefs have been arrested in connection with the incident and they are helping with investigations,” he said.
