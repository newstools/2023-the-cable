The National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC), says excessive fasting can cause kidney problems. Speaking on Monday at a media briefing in Abuja, Mojisola Adeyeye, NAFDAC director-general, advised Nigerians to fast “with common sense”. “We are a very religious country – Muslims and Christians, we fast a lot and it is part of the kidney problem. Your body has to have homeostatic balance, meaning the water level in your body must be enough to make your organs function,” she said. “Some people will fast for 20 days or 10 days without drinking even a little bit of water and the kidney is being punished and it can damage your kidney because the kidney does not have water to dilute and filter, that is what some of us do. “I fast but I fast with common sense. You have to fast with common sense or else you pay with your kidney.” The director-general also disclosed that the agency had destroyed unregistered pharmaceuticals worth N95 billion. She said the destruction was done in December 2022 after four and half years of monitoring with the help of the government of Benin Republic. The products destroyed were tramadol 200mg and higher-strength, diclofenac tablets. She warned Nigerians to only purchase medicines from pharmacies. “Do not buy medicines from hawkers, do not buy medicines from corner stores, buy medicines from pharmacies.”
