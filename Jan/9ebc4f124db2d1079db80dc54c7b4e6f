Sonia Ekweremadu, daughter of Ike Ekweremadu, former deputy senate president, was absent from a United Kingdom court where she is facing criminal charges. At the resumed court trial on Monday, Sonia’s defence team said she was unable to attend court as she is currently in hospital with an unspecified condition. Her lawyers have also submitted a psychological report, claiming she is not fit to stand trial. Consequently, the court adjourned to allow the prosecutors to examine the report. Ekweremadu’s daughter is said to be suffering from kidney disease and needs a transplant. She is standing trial alongside her parents — Ekweremadu and Beatrice, his wife, were present at the resumed hearing. They are facing charges bordering on conspiracy to arrange/facilitate the travel of another person with a view to exploitation, namely organ harvesting. The couple was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police in June and appeared before a magistrate court in July. Ekweremadu’s wife was granted bail on July 22, but the senator’s request was denied. The police had alleged that David Ukpo, the reported victim at the centre of the organ harvesting allegation, is a 15-year-old but the court ruled that he is 21. In December, the court also refused Ekweremadu’s fresh bail application on the ground that the senator “remains a flight risk”.
