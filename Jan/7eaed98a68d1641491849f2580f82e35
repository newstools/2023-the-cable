The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the judgement of the Osun governorship election tribunal that sacked Ademola Adeleke as governor of the state. Debo Ologunagba, PDP national publicity secretary, said the judgment is contrary to the will of the people “which was expressed by the overwhelming votes cast for our party and candidate at the election”. “The July 16, 2022 Governorship election in Osun State was adjudged by Local and International Observers to be free, fair, transparent and clearly won by the PDP and our Candidate, Governor Ademola Adeleke in confirmation of the wishes and aspirations of the people,” the party said in a statement on Saturday. “The will of the people of Osun State as expressed by electing Governor Adeleke must be respected. As a law-abiding Party, the PDP will explore all available legal means to restore the victory of our Party. “The PDP charges the people of Osun State to be calm, remain at alert and continue to support Governor Adeleke as we restate our confidence in the institution of the judiciary to dispense justice in this matter at the Appellate Court.” TheCable had reported how the Osun governorship election petition tribunal ruled in favour of Gboyega Oyetola, former governor of the state. Delivering judgment on Friday, two out of the three-member panel of the tribunal held that Oyetola was able to prove that there was over-voting in some of the polling units. Consequently, the majority judgment of the tribunal ordered INEC to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Adeleke and recognise Oyetola as the duly-elected governor of Osun. Meanwhile, Adeleke has vowed to appeal the judgement. He described the ruling as “a miscarriage of justice” adding that it is “an unfair interpretation against the will of majority of voters”.
