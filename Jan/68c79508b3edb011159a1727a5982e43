Efe Ajagba, the Nigerian boxer, has defeated his American opponent Stephan Shaw in a heavyweight main event fight at the Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona, New York. The Nigerian fared the better contender throughout the 10 rounds of the hard-hitting bout in the early hours of Sunday. Shaw had been undefeated in his heavyweight career until he faced Ajagba, a reputable knockout specialist. The judges — Eric Marlinski, John McKaie and Don Trella — scored the bout identically, 96-94 for Ajagba. The victory takes the 28-year-old Nigerian’s record to 17-1. His only loss was against Cuba’s Frank Sanchez in the Tyson Fury-Deontay Wilder undercard in October 2021 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. As an amateur boxer, the Ughelli-born pugilist won gold at the 2015 All Africa Games in Congo Brazaville and a bronze medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. He came into the limelight at the 2016 Olympics in Rio where he floored Nigel Paul of Trinidad and Tobago with a powerful blow in the first round. He was stopped by Ukraine’s Ivan Dychko in the quarter-final by unanimous decision of 28-29, 28-29, 28-29.
