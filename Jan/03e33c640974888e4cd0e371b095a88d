Gunmen, on Saturday, reportedly killed a police officer during an attack on a permanent voter card (PVC) collection centre in Imo state. According to a report by The Nation newspaper, several persons sustained injuries. Efforts to reach Michael Abattam, spokesperson of the Imo police command, were not successful at the time of this report. The attack, which reportedly occurred in Ahiazu Mbaise LGA of Imo state, disrupted the PVC collection exercise as people fled for safety. An official of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), identified as Chienyere Chijioke-Osuji, was said to have confirmed the attack. “It happened at Ahiazu Mbaise today. A policeman was gunned down, not an INEC staff member. No corps member was wounded, though my AEO Ops, Barrister Kingsley Ohiri, and the CLO of the LG dislocated their leg and arm while jumping over the fence,” Chijioke-Osuji was quoted as saying. “Please reach out to Barrister Ohiri. Glory be to God for saving our lives. It’s really unfortunate we lost the chief security officer to the LGA.” The development comes amid recent attacks on INEC offices in parts of the country. Although the electoral commission has expressed concern over the spate of attacks, INEC has said there are no plans to postpone the general election over insecurity.
