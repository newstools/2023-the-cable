The trio of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and Sadio Mane have been nominated for the 2022 Best FIFA Men’s Player Award. The world football governing body announced the finalists for the prize in a statement on its website on Thursday. The award recognises a footballer’s achievement throughout the entirety of the year. Mohamed Salah, Karim Benzema and Neymar also made the 14-man shortlist for the prize. Others on the list include Julian Alvarez, Jude Bellingham, Kevin de Bruyne, Erling Haaland, Robert Lewandowski, Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior. Cristiano Ronaldo missed out on the shortlist following his underwhelming display for Manchester United and Portugal. In the coach category, Lionel Scaloni leads the pack against Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, Didier Deschamps and Walid Regragui. The public voting process will commence on January 12 and end on February 3 before the winner is announced at The Best FIFA Football Awards ceremony billed for later in the year.
