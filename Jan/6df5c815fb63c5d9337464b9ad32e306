Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, says the accident at the Ojuelegba bridge would be thoroughly investigated. Frederic Oladeinde, commissioner for transportation said this in a statement on Monday. On Sunday, nine persons were killed after a container-laden truck fell on a bus at the Ojuelegba bridge. Nine persons were injured and treated in a hospital. Oladeinde quoted Sanwo-Olu as assuring that the accident would be thoroughly investigated to prevent future accidents. The governor, on behalf of the people and the government, also sympathised with the families of those who died in the truck accident. “We are working with the federal ministry of works and housing to install vehicle/truck barriers on the inward and outward sections of the bridge,” he said. “We share the grief of those who lost their loved ones in the accident and pray that the Almighty will strengthen them at this difficult time.” He said that the government would continue to implement its transport master plan, which had safety strategies that would ensure safer roads. Meanwhile, the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has recommended the construction of barricades on the Ojuelegba bridge to restrict the movement of articulated vehicles. The agency said the barricades would serve as a permanent solution to the reoccurring crashes.
