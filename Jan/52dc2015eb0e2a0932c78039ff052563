Odion Ighalo, former Super Eagles striker, says he is not worried about the threat that Cristiano Ronaldo poses to his chances of retaining the golden boot prize in the Saudi Pro League. Ighalo spoke in a recent chat with OmaSportsTV in Saudi Arabia. The Nigerian was the league’s highest goal scorer for the 2021/22 season with 24 goals. His goals helped Al-Hilal to win their 18th title in the process. Earlier this month, Al-Nassr, one of the biggest clubs in the league, broke the bank to sign Cristiano Ronaldo on a deal that will earn the Portuguese a total of €200 million per year — the highest salary ever paid to a professional footballer — once commercial agreements are included. Ronaldo, a five-times Ballon D’Or winner, has a prolific career as one of the best goalscorers in football history — with over 800 goals. Speaking on Ronaldo’s move to Saudi, Ighalo praised the Portuguese as the “greatest of all time”. But the Ajegunle-born striker added that he welcomes the challenge that Ronaldo brings, saying they will both score for their respective teams. “No. [I am not worried about Ronaldo’s arrival]. But Ronaldo is a legend. He is the best, for me, he is the greatest of all time,” Ighalo said. “I have too much respect and admiration for him. “But he is going to play for his own team and he will score goals and me, I am going to play for my own team and I will score goals.” Ighalo is third on the Saudi Pro League goal chart for the season with nine goals behind Brazil’s Talisca and Abdelrrazak Hamdallah.
