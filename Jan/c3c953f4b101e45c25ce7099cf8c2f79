Gunmen have abducted Kefas Ishaya, the catechist of St. Monic catholic church in Kaduna state. According to NAN, Ishaya was said to have been abducted on Thursday around 9:30 pm at Ikulu-Pari, Chawai chiefdom in Kauru LGA of the state. The Parish was said to have held its annual thanksgiving service on Sunday. Members of the community suspected the abductors were targeting the proceeds generated during thanksgiving. Sunday Bage, chairman of Ikulu zone of the parish, told NAN that the abductors’ initial target was Joseph Shekari, a reverend father in the community. “Thank God, father (reverend) travelled. They didn’t get him, but they picked our Catechist,” NAN quoted Bage as saying. “They dragged the catechist to the bush. They took him with his phone. We have been calling the line but it keeps ringing out.” Bage added that the gunmen were many and kept shooting sporadically, moving through the church, the school and the priest’s residence in search of Shekari. Church neighbours said the gunmen broke into the residence of the priest after scaling through the fence. They were said to have broken the main door to the house using stones and bullets. “Immediately they broke into the house, they searched and ransacked everywhere,” a neighbour told NAN. “They checked under the beds, wardrobes, bathrooms and kitchen. “They even checked the ceiling, but father had travelled. So, they did not get him. “In anger, they took our catechist. As we speak, he is with them in the bush. “It is a very sad situation. This is devastating. They dragged Catechist on the ground like a dog.”
