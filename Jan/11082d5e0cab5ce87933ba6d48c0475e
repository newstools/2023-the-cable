A Grade I Area court in Dei-dei area of the federal capital territory (FCT), Abuja has ordered Mohammed Musa, a 28-year-old labourer, to sweep the community police station in the area for stealing N50,000 from his neighbour. Musa, a resident of the Kubwa area in the FCT pleaded guilty to the charges pressed against him – and begged the court for leniency when delivering judgement. Chinedu Ogada, the prosecution counsel, told the court that Abubakar Shuaibu whose money was stolen reported the case to the Dutsen Alhaji police station in Abuja on January 3. The prosecutor said on December 28, 2022, at about 2 pm, the convict told the complainant that someone sent him money through the complainant’s bank account. He then asked the complainant to give him his phone to check if the money was sent. Ogada said Musa transferred the money without the consent of the complainant and ran to an unknown place after which he was caught and handed over to the police. The prosecutor said during the investigation, Musa confessed to committing the offence while the money was recovered from him. Ogada added that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 322 and 288 of the penal code. Delivering judgement, Saminu Suleiman, the judge, ordered Musa to clean the community police station in Dei-dei for a period of six months or pay a fine of N20,000.
