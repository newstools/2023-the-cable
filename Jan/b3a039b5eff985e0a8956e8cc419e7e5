Yemi Akinyinka, general manager of Oyo fire service, said the firefighters were able to put out the inferno around 5am. “Our men are at Araromi Market Agodi Gate since 2:30 a.m. where they are putting of the fire caused by indiscriminate refuse burning,” he said. “The fire was suppressed at 5:00 a.m. Cooling down operation is ongoing to suppress reignition. On my way for on-the-spot assessment. “I cannot say specifically the number of shops now, you know it is an emergency. It started in the night. About 45 shops”. In April 2021, the spare parts market was razed, destroying goods worth millions of naira. The fire outbreak was caused by an electrical surge.
