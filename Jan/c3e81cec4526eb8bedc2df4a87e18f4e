The National Unity Party (NUP), one of the deregistered political parties, says those behind the plot to arrest Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), want to scuttle the general election. Recently, it emerged that the Department of State Services (DSS) had approached a federal high court in Abuja seeking a warrant to arrest Emefiele over allegations that he was involved in terrorism financing and economic crimes. While declining the application, J.T Tsoho, the chief judge, said the secret police did not provide any concrete evidence to substantiate its claims. There were suggestions that the bid to arrest Emefiele might be political given the impact the redesign of the naira and limit on cash withdrawals might have on vote-buying in the elections. Unnamed politicians are said to be behind the plot to arrest the CBN governor. In a statement on Friday, Abubakar Isa, NUP’s director of strategy and outreach, said if the DSS was successful in its application, President Muhammadu Buhari’s plan for a peaceful transition of power would have been unsuccessful. “It is unthinkable that the DSS tried to undermine CBN and INEC efforts for free and fair elections, barely 40 days to the polls,” Isa said. “The court quashed the Department of Security Services move to charge CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele with trumped up charges of terrorism financing and economic crimes. “Justice M.A. Hassan barred the DSS from inviting, arresting, detaining or charging the CBN Governor with any allegation of terrorism or fraudulent act. The Justice described the plot to arrest Emefiele of terrorism as oppressive, baseless, fabricated and unacceptable. “However those who want to scuttle the process are shamelessly seeking to impose an interim government. We at the opposition won’t allow this to happen. and we are urging the culprits to desist from this act.” TheCable had reported that Emefiele, who has been abroad on leave, would be back to the country next week.
