The Osun government says it will not rescind its decision on the workers recruited by Gboyega Oyetola, the state’s former governor. A day after he was sworn in as Osun governor, Ademola Adeleke issued six executive orders including one sacking hundreds of workers employed by Oyetola, his predecessor, some days before he left office. In a statement issued on Monday by Tunde Busari, Adeleke’s special assistant on community communications, the state government said no amount of blackmail will change its decision. The state government said Oyetola “deliberately padded the state payroll with APC members to create a stage for deeper financial crisis, conflict and disharmony”. “Those engaging in demonstrations are APC members smuggled into the state payroll by former Governor Oyetola. By virtue of the Executive Order issued by Mr Governor, those illegally employed remain sacked and are no longer staff of the state government. No amount of demonstration and blackmail can change that reality,” the statement reads. “We have the details of plan by APC to deploy its disengaged members for demonstration. However, the people of Osun state are in the know of the whole situation especially the several warnings by the PDP while in opposition. “We warned against colluding with Mr Oyetola during those last days when the former Governor was issuing employment letter despite the State’s inability to pay staff salaries.” The state government said the Adeleke administration “will not bow to unjustified demands from those who collaborated to deepen” the financial woes of the state.
