Abba Muhammed Bello, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the house of representatives, has been reported dead. Although the circumstances surrounding his death are still sketchy, Bello was said to have died on Friday in Abuja. He was the PDP candidate for the Birnin Kebbi/Kalgo/Bunza federal constituency of Kebbi state for the national assembly election scheduled to take place on February 25. Bello won the ticket in the primary election conducted in May 2022, defeating Mohammed Bello-Yakubu, his closest challenger. He is the son of Muhammed Haliru Bello, former acting national chairman of the PDP. Bello’s demise comes a few hours after the death of Mathew Akawu, PDP candidate for Pengana constituency in Plateau state house of assembly. In a social media post on Friday, Atiku Abubakar, PDP presidential candidate, described their demise as “big blows to the PDP”.
