The 35-year-old’s encounter against Tsitsipas represented the largest age gap in an Australia Open men’s singles final in the Open era. He won 94 percent of his first serve points in the opening set with nine winners and seven unforced errors. Djokovic has now drawn level with Rafael Nadal at the top of the men’s standings with 22 Grand Slam titles — and he’s expected to ascend to No.1 on the rankings. The Serbian took home $2.975 million in prize money for winning the Australia Open.
