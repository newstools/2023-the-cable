According to NAN, Eric Anderson, Cross River commissioner for information, announced this in a statement on Friday.

He also advised civil servants in the state to take advantage of the work-free days to get themselves prepared to make their votes count in the elections. “Government wishes to make it clear for the benefit of members of the public that though work-free, members of the public are expected to take advantage of the days to get their PVCs and not just sit at home,” the statement reads. “It is important that members of the public get their PVCs in readiness to make their votes count in the coming election. “Your PVC is the pathway to achieving credible elections, get yours now.” Also, Biodun Oyebanji, governor of Ekiti, declared January 24, a work- free day.
