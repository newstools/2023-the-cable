Several buildings have been razed in the Okoja area of Ikare-Akoko town in Ondo, following an outbreak of violence in the community. Speaking with NAN on Wednesday, a resident, whose name wasn’t given, said there were gunshots after some persons disrupted a New Year carnival organised by youths in Okoja. “Youths of the Okoja area of the town organised a New Year carnival on Tuesday at the area’s market square,” the resident said. “Some people went to disrupt the carnival, claiming that the organisers did not obtain approval from the traditional ruler, the Owa-Ale of Ikare. “They burnt the house of the Olokoja, a high chief of the quarters, and that of another chief, while many shops were razed. “I have been informed that they are going to my house to burn it and I don’t know what we people of Okoja quarters did to deserve this.” On his part, Adeleke Adedoyin, the Owa-Ale of Ikare, said the violence started on Tuesday, adding that he reported the incident to the police. “When the crisis started on Tuesday and I was informed, I called the attention of the Nigeria police and commander of the Nigerian Army in the town for peace to reign, which was achieved immediately,” he said. “Unfortunately, on Wednesday, some gun-toting people emerged from only God knows where and started shooting sporadically in the direction of a popular junction close to my palace.” Olufunmilayo Odunlami-Omisanya, police spokesperson in the state, confirmed the incident but said no casualty has been confirmed. “No casualty whatsoever had been recorded to the best of my knowledge. The warring parties have been warned to maintain peace. Policemen and soldiers are patrolling the town to ensure law and order within the area,” the police spokesperson said.
