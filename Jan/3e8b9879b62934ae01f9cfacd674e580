Bola Tinubu, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has asked residents of Enugu state to support his presidential bid. Tinubu spoke on Wednesday at a campaign rally in Enugu. The former governor of Lagos said the residents should get their permanent voters cards (PVCs) and not get frustrated in the process of doing so. “You are working hard and sweating now. We want you to sweat well for this party until you deliver victory, until Bola Tinubu becomes the president for the federal republic of Nigeria,” he said. “Go and pick your PVC, no matter how much they try to frustrate you. Don’t be frustrated. That PVC is a liberation card, a success card; it is a gold mine. Don’t kid with it. “As you pray, be ready to sacrifice for Nigeria. Anybody who tells you that you cannot do something, tell them we have focus, brain — you can do it. Go and look at Lagos; it is a state that is better than some countries. “Your brothers are living well there. No Igbo man – well they bring money for me in Lagos. I don’t blame them, you want my land, you’ve got to pay. “Here you are, if the federal government collaborates with you, if you elect me as the president – [there will] be an industrial hub for Enugu. “For Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra, Abia – deep sea ports and fabricating engines. Enugu will become an industrial hub, greater than before. There will be jobs for all of you. You have incredible mineral resources to propel economic recovery. “You are also an agricultural powerhouse that can produce many cash crops.”
