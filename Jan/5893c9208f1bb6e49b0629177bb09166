The European Union (EU), says its Managing Conflict in Nigeria (MCN) scheme, has helped traditional rulers in the north-east resolve over 44,000 disputes in 2022 alone. The MCN is an initiative of the EU and it is implemented by the British Council in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states. Speaking in Abuja on Tuesday, Muhammed Tabiu, MCN programme manager, said the EU has been able to train 2,404 traditional rulers on the best ways of handling conflict resolution. Tabiu said the disputes range from farmer-herder conflicts, business disputes, family and domestic concerns, and theft, among others. “The programme was also to support each emirate to establish a record-keeping center for documenting identified and engaged issues,” he said. “To use data obtained from different levels to plan a response, decision making, and other specific purposes such as in addressing sexual and gender-based violence. “To sanitize the traditional justice system conflict management mechanisms and approach, a standard code of conduct was developed in a close working relationship with the emirate councils, ministries for local government and chieftaincy affairs, and other stakeholders. “The code of conduct provides an accountable mechanism for the operation of the traditional rulers in each of the three states as well as in the emirates. “As of July 2022, these emirates have resolved about 44,411 different cases ranging from disputes between farmers and herders, business disputes, family and domestic concerns, theft and other.” Muhammad Idrissa, the emir of Fika, said the traditional institutions are instrumental in peace-building in any society. “It is a global belief that for any developmental programme to be sustainable, especially in the areas of peacebuilding and effective conflict management, the traditional institutions are critical for the desired successes,” the emir said.
