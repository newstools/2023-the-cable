Ogenyi Onazi, former Super Eagles midfielder, has joined Bahrain’s East Riffa FC from Serie D side FC Casertana. The club announced the transfer in a post on its Instagram page. The 30-year-old Nigerian was signed alongside the Brazilian duo of Yuri and Flavio. The duration and details of the contract are yet to be revealed. “East Rifa Club signs Brazilians Yuri, Flavio and Nigerian Onazi to represent the first team in the second division for the current season,” the statement reads. Prior to joining East Riffa, Onazi was spotted training with Remo Stars ahead of the upcoming Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season. The Ikenne-based club announced that the midfielder only visited the club to motivate the players. Onazi was formerly with FC Casertana, a club he joined in August 2022 after a brief spell as a free agent. He was with Saudi Arabia’s Al-Adalah before his deal was cut short. Stints with Turkey’s Denizlispor and Lithuania’s Zalgiris had preceded. He was part of the Super Eagles team that won the 2013 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) trophy in South Africa.
