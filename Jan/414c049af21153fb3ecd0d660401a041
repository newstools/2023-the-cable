The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says it has not shut down the Tom Ikimi train station in Igueben LGA of Edo state, following the recent attack by herdsmen at the facility. On Saturday, gunmen suspected to be herdsmen, kidnapped many passengers from the station. The travellers were said to have been waiting to board a train to Warri in Delta, when they were kidnapped by the suspects on Saturday evening. According to the state police command, the herdsmen had stormed the train station with AK 47 rifles and shot sporadically into the air before abducting the passengers into the bush, while others were said to have sustained bullet wounds. Following the development, a WhatsApp message reportedly posted on an NRC passengers group, said the station has been temporarily closed. “This is to inform our general public and most especially our esteemed passengers, that Ekehen station has been temporarily closed due security issues, till further notice,” it reads. On Sunday however, Fidet Okhiria, managing director of the NRC, told TheCable that the facility has not been shut down. He said the train will no longer stop at the station for now, but only pass through. “The train station has not been shut down. The only thing is that we’re not stopping there. If we shut it down, the train will not be able to pass through,” he said. Another message reads: “Due to the incident at Ekehen station yesterday, WITS 01/ 02 will no longer stop at HEN station. Please advise your customers”. Although the message corroborates Okhiria’s statement, TheCable could not confirm its source. Meanwhile, the federal government had condemned the act, saying it was saddened by the “barbaric” incident. It assured Nigerians that efforts will be made to rescue the kidnapped passengers.
