Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), says if elected, his administration will ensure significant developmental projects are channelled to the north. Speaking on Saturday at a rally in Maiduguri, the Borno capital, Obi said his plans for the north would include focus on agriculture and education. Addressing supporters of the party, he said with the LP administration, there would be a “new Nigeria”. “We want you to hold us responsible for a new Nigeria. For a long time, people have wasted the future of Nigerians and we cannot continue like that,” he said. “We will secure and restore Nigeria to what it should be. “My administration has big plans for the north, particularly in areas of agriculture and education that will help pull it out of poverty.” On his part, Datti Baba-Ahmad, LP vice-presidential candidate, said he believes Obi’s experience as a governor will provide the necessary background for quality representation as president. Baba-Ahmed also said LP remains the alternative to make the country better. In her remarks, Aisha Yesufu, an activist, urged residents to participate actively in the elections, while Ibrahim Mshelia, Borno LP governorship candidate, urged the people not to sell their votes but to support the LP. Obi also visited the southern part of the state, the Shehu of Borno’s palace, and held meetings with youth and women groups.
