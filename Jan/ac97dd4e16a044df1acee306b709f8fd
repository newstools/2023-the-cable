Troops of operation Forest Sanity have killed four suspected bandits in Kaduna state. Musa Danmadami, director of defence media operations, announced the development in a statement on Tuesday. Danmadami said the troops killed two “bandits” at Rafin Sarki village in Giwa LGA of Kaduna while responding to distress calls of attacks. He said the troops engaged the bandits in a gun duel and recovered one AK-47 rifle. In another development, Danmadami said troops, in an ambush operation on Tuesday, killed two bandits at Rafin Taba village in Giwa LGA of Kaduna. He said items recovered included five mobile phones, four AK-47 magazines, two AK-47 rifles, two motorcycles, one cutlass, and the sum of N206,000. “The military high command commends troops of operation Forest Sanity and encourages the general public to avail troops with credible and timely information on criminal activities,” NAN quoted Danmadami as saying. The development comes days after troops of the Nigerian Army killed 10 suspected bandits during raids on hideouts across communities in Kaduna state. Eight suspected bandits were also killed during ambush patrols in Chikun and Birnin Gwari areas, while two gunmen were killed during a patrol in Sabon Birni-Maidaro-Dogon Dawa-Galadimawa-Kidandan-Fatika axis. Also, in December 2022, troops of the Nigerian Army, in multiple operations, killed nine suspected bandits in Giwa LGA of Kaduna state and rescued women and children.
