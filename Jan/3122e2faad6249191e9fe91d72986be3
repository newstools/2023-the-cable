Juliet Ikhayere, the African Democratic Congress (ADC) house of representatives candidate in Abuja, has shared pictures of her together with Peter Obi, standard bearer of the Labour Party (LP), to solicit votes. The ADC candidate who is running for the AMAC and Bwari federal constituencies shared the pictures on her official Twitter handle on Monday. She called on her supporters who intend to mount billboards in support to use the pictures she shared alongside the LP candidate. “If God lays in your kind heart to mount billboards on my behalf in the AMAC and Bwari Area Council, please here are pictures. No help is small. Tell 10 to tell 10 people to vote me. I simply need an average of 200 votes in 1500 polling units and I will win on a landslide,” Ikhayere wrote.
