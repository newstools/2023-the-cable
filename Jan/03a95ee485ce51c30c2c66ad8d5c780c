Airtel Nigeria, a subsidiary of Airtel Africa Plc, has introduced its embedded subscriber identity modules (eSIM) services on its network. The initiative comes two years after MTN Nigeria began the use of eSIM, the first in West Africa. An eSIM (embedded-SIM) is a programmable SIM card that is embedded directly into a smartphone or wearable device. The new technology is useful for frequent travellers and tourists, making it easy for them to opt for and keep a local subscription when visiting Nigeria. In a statement on Tuesday, Airtel said customers who wish to switch their current physical SIM cards for eSIM can now do so as the service is now immediately available on its network. It also said for successful usage, customers must ensure the availability of a compatible device, obtain the required QR code by dialling *#06#, and be guided through a SIM Swap process by Airtel service personnel. Airtel’s management said it believes that the digital SIM will significantly improve the productivity of Nigerians, helping its stakeholders to achieve personal and professional goals. Speaking on the development, Femi Oshinlaja, assistant chief commercial officer, Airtel Nigeria, said Airtel Nigeria was always at the forefront in championing technological advancement and creating innovative platforms and opportunities that will make life better, more exciting, and more enjoyable “for all those in our stakeholder value chain”. “With eSIM, we are not only bringing the latest technology to the fingertips of our customers, but we are also focusing on our sustainability goals of digital inclusion and environmental best practices as no plastic is involved with eSIM,” Oshinlaja said. “It is therefore our commitment to continue to create offerings that will expand and deepen our digital footprints in line with our positioning as the network of first choice in Nigeria for everything mobile internet, digital and home broadband.”
