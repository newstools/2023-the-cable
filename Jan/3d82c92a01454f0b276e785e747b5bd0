President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the senate to confirm Solomon Arase, a former inspector-general of police (IGP), as the chairman of the Police Service Commission (PSC). Buhari’s request was contained in a letter read by Ahmad Lawan, the senate president on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Tuesday. The president based his request on sections 153 (1) and 154 (1) of the constitution as amended. Arase, the 18th IGP, retired as the head of the Nigeria Police about a year after President Buhari assumed office. The former IGP was appointed by former president Goodluck Jonathan. In October 2020, Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson, quoted Buhari as saying he wished he worked with him longer. “The president told me how much he had been impressed with Arase, and how he regretted that the man spent just about a year with him,” Adesina had said. In a separate letter, Buhari asked the upper legislative chamber to confirm the reappointment of Mahmud Isa as resident electoral commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Kebbi and the new appointment of Sani Ali for the same position in Ondo.
