A high court sitting in Yola, Adamawa state, has restrained the All Progressives Congress (APC) from recognising Elisha Abbo as its senatorial candidate for Adamawa north in the forthcoming general election. In the judgment delivered on Tuesday, Mohammed Danladi, the presiding judge, held that having been expelled from his ward, the senator cannot seek nomination under the party or re-election. The judge said the expulsion of the lawmaker by the Mubi north local government council executives on October 7, 2022, binds Abbo and the APC. The council had expelled Abbo for alleged anti-party activities following his criticism and resistance to the APC’s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket. The court, in its judgment, further restrained the senator from parading himself as the candidate of the party for the senatorial district. During the court hearings, the judge held the senator had full opportunity to present his defence but chose not to do so. He further ruled that the plaintiffs’ lawsuit against the senator was not an internal party matter as alleged, and that they had locus standi to file the lawsuit against Abbo since they were official party members. Abbo has said he would appeal the judgment.
