The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) says it is working to ensure that the five percent employment reservation is fully implemented for persons with disabilities (PWDs) in the country. According to the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act, 2018, it is mandatory for public institutions to have at least five percent of employees who are PWDs. Speaking on Thursday at a disability stakeholders forum organised by Centre for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) in Abuja, Usman Baba, inspector-general of police, said efforts are ongoing to ensure full implementation. Baba, represented by Aina Adesola, deputy commissioner of police administration, said the police is also working towards improving its relations with PWDs in the country. “I am very sure that the present administration has done and is doing almost everything to make sure that there is a cordial relationship between the police and the disability community,” the deputy police commissioner said. “There is a standing instruction in every command that the police act swiftly to the contacts from the disability community, especially with regards to complaints. “And as regards to employment of disabled people, it is relative and I am very sure that there are disabled people in the Nigeria police, though they may not be in operations, but in other departments because of the disability which is relative, because it is not that we have to take them from all clusters of disabilities. “Like the blind, the physically challenged, however, there are many people with disabilities and the force is working to fully implement and execute the five percent empowerment reservation for PWDs.”
