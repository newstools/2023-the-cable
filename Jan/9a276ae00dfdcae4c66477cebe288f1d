Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says it will be disastrous to give the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) another chance. Tinubu spoke on Saturday at a rally held at Mallam Aminu Kano Triangle in Dutse, capital city of Jigawa state. The former governor of Lagos said the PDP would destroy everything if it comes back to power in 2023. “You did the courageous job of chasing away the locusts eight years ago; do not trust their deceptive promises. Do not let them back into power. Like locusts, they will devour everything in their path,” Tunde Rahman, Tinubu’s media aide, quoted him as saying. “Instead, vote for the people that have a track record of delivering prosperity to the people. We did it in Lagos and Borno, and with your help, we will do it again for Nigeria. “Vote for the people with the vision, the capacity, the competence and the integrity to do what is right. Vote for responsive and responsible leadership. Vote for us. Vote for the APC on February 25 and March 11.” If elected, Tinubu said, he would consolidate on the ongoing infrastructural developments across the country. “We will use the road network to connect our major agricultural and industrial hubs,” he said. “Most importantly, we will secure our nation and defeat the menace posed by evil criminals, kidnappers, bandits and terrorists. We will sweep them away. Broom! “We will do so by recruiting and deploying more security personnel across the various agencies, improving their equipment and training and deploying top shelf technology to improve ground and aerial surveillance in key and dangerous areas.”
