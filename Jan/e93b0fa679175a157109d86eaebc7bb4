Samson Adegoke, the rector of Osun State College of Technology, on Monday escaped an attempt on his life by suspected ‘assassins’. Adegoke was travelling from Esa-Oke to Ilesa town with his driver when the incident happened. The assailants had opened fire on his vehicle — a Toyota Camry — and riddled the car with gunshots. The rector and his driver were said to have survived the attack unhurt as the driver did not stop the car during the attack. Speaking with Punch, he said the matter had been reported to the police in Ijebu-Jesa. “It happened between 3:30 and 4 pm on Monday at Eti Oni junction, (an area between Ijebu Jesa and Esa Oke). I was coming from school (Esa Oke), and a Toyota Camry was trying to drive against traffic and overtake us,” Adegoke was quoted by the newspaper. “Unfortunately for him, a tipper was coming, so the car could not overtake us. And we were able to go ahead. Thereafter, the car drove close to us and opened fire but we didn’t stop. “We were going until the vehicle could no longer move again. I reported the incident to the police at Ijebu Jesa police station and they are on it. Police said they are taking steps.” When contacted, Yemisi Opalola, the Osun state police spokesperson, told TheCable the matter is under investigation. “We have heard it (the attack), the investigation is ongoing please,” she said.
