Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), has assured residents of Borno state that insecurity will be a thing of the past if his party wins. Obi said this on Wednesday during a visit to Biu LGA in the southern part of Borno state. Several LGAs in Borno have been affected by insurgency, although residents are gradually returning to their homes following the recent closure of IDP camps across the state. The LP candidate was accompanied by Datti Baba-Ahmed, his running mate; Julius Abure, national chairman of the LP; Ibrahim Mshelia, Borno LP governorship candidate; Isaac Balami, deputy campaign manager of LP; and other stakeholders of the party. Speaking to a crowd drawn from various LGAs, the LP candidate promised them that if elected, his administration will ensure that he prioritises the people’s welfare. “I am one of you and feel your plight. I know that you are all hardworking and want to go back to your farms,” Obi said. “I am giving you my word that this insecurity issue will be a thing of the past in my administration and I will ensure that my government gives you the best of life. “Thank you for everything you have done for the country and I will never forget you. A new Nigeria is possible.” Obi’s comment comes amid recent concerns by the Independent National Electoral Commission over the low permanent voter card (PVC) collection rate in the state. Shuaibu Ibrahim, INEC’s head of department, voter education and publicity in the state, had recently said only 23 percent of available PVCs have been collected in Borno as of January 5.
