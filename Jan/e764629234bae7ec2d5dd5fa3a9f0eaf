Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says only his party can restore peace in Niger state. Atiku spoke on Saturday at the PDP presidential campaign rally in Minna, the capital of Niger state. In the past few months, the north-central state has recorded frequent attacks by bandits who abduct residents and demand ransom; and in some instances, kill their victims. Atiku said while the PDP was in power, the state did not witness a high number of attacks. “Firstly, we thank you for gathering here and for the support you have shown to us since we came to Niger,” Atiku said in Hausa. “May God bring back peace to Niger, which you know apart from the PDP no other party can bring back this peace. “When the PDP was in power from 1999-2015, was there insecurity in Niger? Therefore, we want to assure you that if you vote back the PDP into power in Niger, insecurity will become a thing of the past by God’s grace. “Also, the construction of the seaport in Baro was started by the PDP before you said you wanted change, and you have seen the change. “What did the change bring to you? Insecurity, suffering, bad economy. Therefore, we are begging you to vote back PDP to restore security in Niger state and the country at large. “People of Niger, I would like to remind you that most of the schools, hospitals universities, roads, any road you see in Minna and Niger state was constructed by PDP. Is that not so? Atiku added that the residents of the state have another chance to bring real change to the state by voting PDP.
