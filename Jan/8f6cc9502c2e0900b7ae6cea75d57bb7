The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) says it received eight power transformers funded by the World Bank through the Nigeria electricity transmission and access project (NETAP). NETAP is an initiative of the federal government and its partners, with an objective to increase the evacuation capacity of the transmission network in Nigeria. In a statement on Thursday, Ndidi Mbah, general manager, public affairs, TCN, said the transformers arrived at the Apapa port in Lagos. She said the project management unit of the transmission company received the eight brand new transformers, adding that the facilities would boost the evacuation of electricity nationwide. The transformers, according to Mbah, include six 150/187.5 mega volt ampere (MVA), 330/132/33 kilovolt (kV) power transformers, and two 100/125MVA, 132/33kV power transformers. She noted that arrangements were being concluded to move the facilities from the ports to the locations where the transformers would be deployed. “The 2×150/187.5MVA, 330/132/33kV, would be installed in Bauchi state,” Mbah said. “1×150/187.5MVA, 330/132/33kV in Mayo Belwa; 1×150/187.5MVA, 330/132kV in Yola; 1×150/187.5MVA, 330/132/33kV in Maiduguri; 1×150/187.5MVA, 330/132/33kV in Damaturu; and 2×100/125MVA, 132/33kV in Yola. “TCN, through the EPC contractor (MBH), will move all the transformers to TCN substations mentioned above. The project is among the World Bank funded projects under NETAP. “The transformers are part of the ongoing grid expansion projects under TCN’s project management unit.” Among other factors, Nigeria’s power sector is confronted by low transmission wheeling capacity against the total installed generation capacity of 12,522MW. According to Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), the country has a wheeling capacity of 7,500MW. Epileptic power supply, evidenced by incessant national grid collapses, has gravely impacted businesses of various scales, especially small business and manufacturers. According to the World Bank, Nigeria is the worst country in the world in terms of people without electricity access, adding that businesses in the nation lose about $29 billion yearly due to unreliable electricity. The World Bank-sponsored NETAP project is only one of the TCN donor-funded projects aimed at expanding the transmission grid, while also prioritising maintenance of existing transmission infrastructures. In February, 2022, TCN took delivery of 15 brand new power transformers under the initiative.
