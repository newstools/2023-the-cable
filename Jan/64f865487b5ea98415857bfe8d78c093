At least nine people have been confirmed dead in a stampede during a New Year’s celebration in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. The incident happened in the early hours of Sunday at the Freedom City Mall in the Namasuba suburb of the city. Luke Owoyesigyire, deputy spokesperson of Kampala metropolitan police, said the stampede happened “when an event emcee encouraged attendees to go outside and watch a fireworks display”. He said five people died at the scene and four others died of their injuries at the hospital. “Very many people got stuck as they were entering in large numbers to see fireworks. In doing so, many people suffocated to death. So far nine people are confirmed dead,” he added. Although the police are yet to confirm the identities of the victims, a 10-year-old boy was said to have been killed in the stampede. “The Katwe Territorial Police are investigating an incident of rash and neglect that occurred at a New Year’s Eve event at the Freedom City Mall Namasuba and resulted in the deaths of nine people, including several juveniles,” the Ugandan Police Force tweeted. “It is alleged that the incident occurred at midnight when the event’s MC encouraged attendees to go outside and watch the fireworks display. “After the display ended, a stampede ensued, resulting in the instant deaths of five people and injuries to several others.” . @Lukowoyesigyire "The Katwe Territorial Police are investigating an incident of rash and neglect that occurred at a New Year's Eve event at the Freedom City Mall Namasuba and resulted in the deaths of nine people, including several juveniles"1/3 — Uganda Police Force (@PoliceUg) January 1, 2023  The Freedom City Mall is said to be a popular venue for music concerts and New Year celebrations in Uganda.
