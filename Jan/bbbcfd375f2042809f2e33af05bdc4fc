Yahaya Bello, the governor of Kogi, says Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is a “president in waiting”. Bello said this on Friday while taking questions from state house correspondents in Abuja, after his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. “Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu has 21 governors — APC governors. He has touched the lives of Nigerians across the board. He is a performer. He is a builder. He built human beings; he built nations, and has started telling us precisely what he is going to do,” the governor said. “His administration, by God’s special grace, will be more run by the younger generation. And you know, surely, that the younger generation constitutes the quantum number of voters in this coming election. “We’re more enlightened. We know that Bola Ahmed Tinubu knows the road. And we are ready to follow that person who knows the road, which is Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “And thank God that he is a candidate of President Muhammadu Buhari. That is why you can see that President Muhammadu Buhari is already campaigning for him, that he will continue where he will stop; to continue to add to the value of what he has put on the ground. “So, the issue of any other person campaigning against him, I mean, you’re only making him more popular. He’s already a good product that has sold himself. He has distinguished himself and we’re all 100 percent ready to vote for Bola Ahmed Tinubu, come the 25th of February, 2023. “And we will joyfully escort him to the villa on May 29, 2023, by the special grace of God. Jagaban is just a president-in-waiting by the special grace of God.”
