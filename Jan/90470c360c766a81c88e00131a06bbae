The supreme court has affirmed Adamu Aliero as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Kebbi central senatorial district in the forthcoming national assembly elections. Delivering judgement on Monday, four out of a five-member panel of the apex court set aside the judgment of the court of appeal. The appeal court in Sokoto had on September 28, 2022, nullified Aliero’s candidacy and affirmed Saidu Haruna as the authentic candidate for Kebbi central. But Centus Nweze, a supreme court justice, held that Aliero’s appeal “is pregnant with merit and is accordingly allowed”. “The judgement of the lower court, which declared Saidu Haruna as winner of the Kebbi central senatorial district primary election is hereby set aside” Amina Augie, who read the lead judgment, said. The panel noted that both the appellant and the first respondent (Haruna) participated in the  June 9, 2022, primary rerun election for Kebbi central, which was won by the appellant. The apex court held that by participating in the rerun, Haruna lost the right to pursue his petition. “By participating in the rerun primary, the 1st respondent, (Haruna) has withdrawn his petition against the conduct of the May 24, 2022, primary election,” the court held. Similarly, the supreme court declared Yahaya Abdullahi as PDP’s candidate for Kebbi north senatorial district. Abdullahi had filed an appeal at the apex court to challenge the decision of the appellate court which had invalidated his candidacy on September 28 and affirmed the candidacy of Sani Argungu. The supreme court held that the lower court lacked the jurisdiction to hear the case. “The lower court was wrong to have heard the matter for want of jurisdiction,” the court said. “Judgment is hereby entered in favour of the appellant. “Judgment of the court below is thereby set aside.”
