Naj’atu Muhammad, a former senator representing Kano central, has resigned her membership from the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a statement on Saturday, Muhammad said parties in the country have no ideological difference, adding that the different parties are like clothes worn by politicians to serve their personal interests. The politician said she is committed to supporting individuals that are truly interested in addressing the root causes of Nigeria’s challenges. “Quitting party politics at this point in time is one of such steps. We all recognize that Nigeria is facing many challenges, including insecurity, poverty, inequality, and lack of access to basic services,” she said. “Such challenges require the consolidated efforts of competent and patriotic leadership across every level of governance. Nigerians must be aware of the severity of their situation after the dismal failures of leadership the country has experienced over the years. “Nigerians must be aware of the consequences of their decisions and their choices. “Therefore, restricting one’s choice to a single political party will be detrimental to the development of our country and our democracy. “As a Nigerian fighting for a better Nigeria, I am deeply committed to the struggle for a more just and equitable society. I believe that all Nigerians deserve the opportunity to live a life of dignity, security and opportunity.”
