Kola Ologbondiyan, spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council, says corruption allegation is “not strange” to the party. Ologbondiyan spoke on Wednesday during an interview on ‘Real Talk with Kike’. In the build-up to the elections, there have been fireworks of corruption allegations and counter-allegations by the PDP and the All Progressives Congress (APC). On Monday, the APC presidential campaign council asked law enforcement agencies to arrest and prosecute Atiku Abubakar, the PDP standard-bearer. The APC campaign premised its request on an audio recording released by Michael Achimugu, a former aide to Abubakar, in which the former vice-president is alleged to have explained how shell organisations were set up to divert public funds. Speaking on Wednesday, Ologbondiyan said allegations against the PDP by the APC do not address the latter’s “failure of governance”. “The issue of allegations of corruption is nothing strange as far as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is concerned,” he said. “The All Progressives Congress (APC), given their mass failure in governance and the inability to present a candidate that will be generally acceptable to Nigerians, have been hanging on the connotation that PDP is corrupt. “That is the song they have sung in the last eight years. That is the song that Nigerians are used to, but they (Nigerians) are not taking them seriously because it does not address the issue of failure in governance. The APC has failed and failed woefully. “It is important to note that subterfuge and blackmail have become central to electioneering in Nigeria. People can come up and say all kinds and manner of things about an individual or anyone who is aspiring for office. But what is important is what is documented.”
