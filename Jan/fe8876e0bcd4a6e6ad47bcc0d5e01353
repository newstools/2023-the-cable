Abba Umar Ganduje, an All Progressives Congress (APC) house of representatives candidate in Kano state, says he would fulfill his promises if elected into office. Abba, son of Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano, is seeking to represent Dawakin Tofa, Rimingado and Tofa federal constituency in the lower legislative chamber. If he wins, he would be replacing Tijjani Abdulkadir Jobe who is serving out his fourth term in office. Speaking with reporters in Abuja, on Sunday, the younger Ganduje said he is seeking to serve his constituents effectively and efficiently. “I wish to say this is not just the usual deceptive campaign theatrics of politicians. This is not also to engage in unfulfilled promises at every election season like this,” he said. “I intend to serve through effective and efficient representation and by bringing the dividends of democracy to the people of the Dawakin Tofa/Tofa/RiminGadu constituency. “Getting to the national assembly on my people’s mandate by God’s grace, my programmes will come through the promotion of legislation that will address our peculiar needs and through direct personal interventions to support the great people of my constituency. “The people of my constituency are yearning for a change and they have assured me of their support to bring about the needed change that will usher in quality representation and development.” The candidate said he is confident of victory. “I have engaged with the real voters and because they trust us, and because we will be accountable, I will not run away from them. So, they have promised me massive votes to change the equation and replace inefficiency in Dawakin Tofa/Tofa/ Rimin Gado federal constituency area of Kano state,” he said.
