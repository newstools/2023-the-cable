Taiwo Awoniyi scored his fourth goal of the season as Nottingham Forest defeated Southampton 1-0 in their English Premier League (EPL) game at the St. Mary Stadium on Wednesday. The 25-year-old Nigerian’s goal was enough to elevate them out of the relegation zone into relative safety. The goal arrived in the 27th minute after Awoniyi harassed Lyanco into a sloppy pass into the feet of Brennan Johnson. The English youngster used his pace efficiently on the break before setting up Awoniyi for a tap-in. The Super Eagles striker was coming off a man-of-the-match display in the 1-1 draw against Chelsea on Sunday. For Southampton, Joe Aribo was introduced in the 64th minute but could not help his team salvage the game. Forest moved to 15th on the EPL log with 17 points, just two above the drop zone. In Serie A, Victor Osimhen failed to continue his blistering goalscoring form for Napoli as the league leader suffered their first defeat of the season to Inter Milan. Edin Dzeko’s bullet header in the 56th minute separated both sides in a high-octane game at the San Siro Stadium. Osimhen, who is the league’s leading goal scorer with 9 finishes, could not register a shot on target. On his part, Ademola Lookman too was caged as Atalanta were held to a thrilling 2-2 by Spezia at the Stadio Alberto Picco. While Cyriel Dessers had his goal ruled out by the VAR in Cremonese’s 1-0 loss to Juventus.
