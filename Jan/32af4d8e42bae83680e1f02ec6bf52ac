Festus Keyamo, spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has taken a swipe at Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), over a comment credited to him. While speaking on Wednesday at a town hall meeting with stakeholders and members of the party in Abeokuta, Atiku promised to give contracts and appointments to those who win their polling units for the PDP. “If I am president, if you come and say you want a job or you want a contract, I will ask you to let me have the result of your polling booth and that is what I am going to direct to everybody because unless we do that, we will not win the elections,” Abubakar had said. “You cannot be following the governor to all the places or the senator to all the places and then you don’t win your polling booth and you come and say you want to be a minister or you want to get this contract.” Reacting to the comments, Keyamo, in a tweet, said the former vice-president has forgotten that the public procurement act stipulates how contracts are awarded. “#Atikugate. A leopard cannot change its skin,” the minister of state for labour said. “He is already promising contracts to political allies, forgetting that there is a law called the Public Procurement Act. Mr. SPV!” #Atikugate. A leopard cannot change its skin. He is already promising contracts to political allies, forgetting that there is a law called the Public Procurement Act. Mr. SPV! https://t.co/P5x9fqCN1c — Festus Keyamo, SAN (@fkeyamo) January 19, 2023
