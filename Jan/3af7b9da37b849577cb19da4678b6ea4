Ten people have reportedly died in a boat mishap that occurred in Koko/Nesse LGA of Kebbi state. According to NAN, Yahaya Bello, chairman of Koko/Besse LGA, said the incident occurred on Tuesday. Bello said the boat was carrying over 100 passengers who were rice farmers to Samanaji, a riverine community in the area. He said the corpses of four females and six males have been recovered, adding that 80 of the passengers were rescued, while the others are yet to be found. “Almost all the passengers are youths; small boys and girls. We have found four female and six male corpses,” he said. “We have rescued more than 80 passengers and we are still searching for the missing others. “Prior to the incident, we had called an emergency meeting with the district head of Dutsin Mari and other traditional rulers and leaders of boat operators in the area. “The meeting was to enlighten them and warn them against the use of rickety, old boats, over-loading, and travelling in the night.” He said efforts are being made to ensure the remaining victims are rescued, adding that the council had earlier distributed 20 new boats to prevent future mishaps. Nafiu Abubakar, police spokesperson in the state, also confirmed the development. Over the years, Kebbi state has recorded incidents of boat mishaps with several persons reported dead. In May 2021, TheCable reported how over 80 people died after a boat capsized in Warra, the headquarters of Ngaski LGA of the state.
