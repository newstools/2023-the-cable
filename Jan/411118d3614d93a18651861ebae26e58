The Lagos police command says it has arrested a couple over their alleged involvement in the torture of two children in Egbeda area of the state. Speaking with TheCable on Saturday, Benjamin Hundeyin, police spokesperson in the state, confirmed the incident. Hundeyin said the woman, identified as Busola Oyediran, is the mother of the children, while one Akebiara Emmanuel is identified as their step father. He said the children, aged two and five, respectively, had physical injuries all over their bodies. The couple were apprehended on Friday after neighbours reported the matter to the police. “The report is correct. The mother is the biological mother of the children but she is no longer with their father. That person is the step-father to the children,” Hundeyin said. “The children are five and two years old. The couple were arrested yesterday.” Also confirming the incident, the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), on its official Twitter page, said the couple will be charge to court on January 16. “The couple is currently in detention and will be arraigned on Monday 16th of January, 2023,” NAPTIP said.
