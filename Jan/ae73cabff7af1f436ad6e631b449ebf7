Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has congratulated Gboyega Oyetola over his victory at the Osun governorship election petition tribunal. In a statement on Friday by Tunde Rahman, Tinubu’s media aide, the APC presidential candidate described Oyetola’s victory as a triumph of courage and perseverance. “I heartily rejoice with Alhaji Adegboyega Oyetola on his much deserved victory at the election tribunal today. It is the victory of light over darkness. A triumph of perseverance, courage and justice over electoral fraud and democratic perversion,” he said. “The forces of darkness plotted to extinguish the able leadership and progressive good governance that improved the quality of life of our people under your leadership. But today, the Tribunal delivered justice and restored the mandate freely given to you and our great party. “I am confident that the good work you championed that was momentarily paused will soon resume and Osun people will be happy again. And together we can renew their hope of a shared prosperity.” TheCable had earlier reported that the governorship election tribunal sacked Ademola Adeleke as governor of Osun state. The tribunal presided over by Tertsea Kume also ruled that Gboyega Oyetola be issued a certificate of return.
