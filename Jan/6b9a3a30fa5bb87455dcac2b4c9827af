Supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, former president of Brazil, have invaded the country’s congress and supreme court. Bolsonaro, lost the presidential election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in October, but his supporters are protesting the outcome of the election asking for Lula’s resignation and that the military should step in. The protesters, who stormed the presidential palace, destroyed properties and also attacked police vans. The police have fired tear gas at the protesters. Lula, who is on an official trip to São Paulo state, described the protest as “acts of vandals and fascists”. “We are going to find out who are the financiers of these vandals who went to Brasilia and they will all pay with the force of law,” Lula said. The protest has been likened to the mob attack on the US Capitol Hill building in 2021 where four persons were reported to have died. Supporters of President Donald Trump breached police lines and stormed the building while Congress was sitting to verify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Trump, who refused to concede the election to Biden, had asked his supporters to march to the congress. Bolsonaro, who is in the US, is said to have ties with the Trump camp.
