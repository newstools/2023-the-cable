Moses Ayom, a former presidential aspirant in the All Progressives Congress (APC), has asked Bola Tinubu, standard bearer of the party, to sustain the economic relationship that Nigeria has with China. In 2016, Nigeria and China signed a number of agreements when President Muhammadu Buhari visited Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart. In a statement on Tuesday, Ayom, also the chief executive officer (CEO) of Granite and Marble, said the agreements, if sustained, would reduce unemployment in the country. “As a member of the president’s entourage to the historic business trip to broker the agreement, I recalled that on the same trip, the $6 billion currency swap deal was achieved,” Ayom said. “Also, a mining company, Granite and Marble, signed a business deal with one of the biggest manufacturer of mining equipment in the world, SBM China Ltd. “I am delighted about the commissioning of the Dangote owned $2.5 billion fertilizer equipment plant in Lagos early last year. I am hopeful that the SBM deal that is meant to be located in Abuja and supported by the central bank with RSSF, will soon take off.” The former aspirant said Tinubu is the best candidate for the presidency. “We believe that a Bola Tinubu is most suitable in consolidating on the economic foundation that Buhari had laid for this country. I also know that Tinubu is a leading light in the business of attracting international investments to Nigerian,” he said. “I have known Tinubu since the days of Iyorchia Ayu’s senate presidency when he, Tinubu, served as the chairman of finance, appropriations, banking and currency of the then senate. “Tinubu has all it takes to rule this country because he has paid his dues as a leader of the party.”
