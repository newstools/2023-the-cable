Rilwanu Adamu, the Emir of Bauchi, has approved the removal of Bello Kirfi, a kingmaker in the Bauchi emirate council, from his position as the Wazirin Bauchi. Born in 1933, Kirfi, a former minister, was said to have been stripped of his position over “disrespect and disloyalty” to Bala Mohammed, governor of Bauchi. Shehu Muhammad, secretary of the Bauchi emirate council, announced the sack in a letter dated December 30, 2022, and addressed to Kirfi. It is, however, not exactly clear how Kirfi “disrespected” the governor. “I am directed to refer to a letter received from the Ministry of Local Government Affairs with reference No: MLG/LG/S/72/T dated 30th December 2022,” the letter reads. “The content of the said letter indicated your disloyalty and disrespect to the Executive Governor of the State and the government. “It, therefore, directed for your removal with immediate effect. “In view of the above, you are hereby removed from office as Wazirin Bauchi and also as a Council Member of Bauchi Emirate. I wish you the best in all your future endeavours.” Meanwhile, Sa’adatu Kirfi, Bauchi commissioner for cooperatives and SMEs development, has resigned from her position. Sa’adatu, said to be the daughter of the former minister, announced her resignation in a letter dated January 4, 2023, and addressed to Bala Mohammed, the Bauchi governor, through the secretary to the state government. “Your Excellency, I wish to humbly tender my resignation as a member, Bauchi state Executive Council and Hon. Commissioner Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs Development, Bauchi state, with immediate effect,” the letter reads. “I wish to thank His Excellency the Executive Governor, for giving me the opportunity to serve my State under your Administration.”
