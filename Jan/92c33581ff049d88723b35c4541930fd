Both parties signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the transfer, settlement, and exit agreement (TSEA). With the agreement, Addax ceased to be the PSC contractor for the four oil mining leases (OMLs) 123, 124, 126 and 137. In April 2021, the defunct department of petroleum resources (DPR) revoked the four Addax licences over poor development of the assets but three weeks later, President Muhammadu Buhari restored the licences.
