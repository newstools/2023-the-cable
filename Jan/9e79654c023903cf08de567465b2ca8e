Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says he will be committed to restructuring if elected president. Abubakar spoke on Thursday during the PDP presidential campaign rally in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi capital. He said if elected, restructuring will be the major policy of his administration, adding that the south-east will be able to attend to local issues through his “power transfer” policy. “I am committed to power devolution and restructuring. All the south-eastern states have been yearning and have been propagating for restructuring of this country because they want to have more powers, more resources to deal with their own local affairs,” he said. “We agree entirely and that is why it is a major policy of our government to be, if you support us and if you give us the opportunity.” “APC had promised the same. Did they do it? They abandoned the issue of restructuring. They are a very deceitful alliance; very deceitful. “We are committed and we mean what we say and if you give us the support, we will deliver. “They said some people formed a party. It is not a party; it is an alliance and the alliance is collapsing and it has collapsed.” Meanwhile, Abubakar defected to the APC from the PDP in 2014. He had, however, resigned his membership of the APC in November 2017, saying “the party we put in place has failed and continues to fail our people, especially our young people”.
