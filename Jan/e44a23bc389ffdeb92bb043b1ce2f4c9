Alkali Baba, inspector general of police (IGP), has recommended the redeployment of two commissioners of police. The affected commissioners are Frank Mba and Idowu Owohunwa. In a letter dated January 24, 2023, and signed by Hafiz Inuwa, assistant inspector general of police to the Police Service Commission (PSC), they were recommended for posting to Ogun and Lagos states. While Owohunwa would be replacing Abiodun Alabi in Lagos, Mba is expected to take over from Lanre Bankole in Ogun. The proposed redeployment comes less than a month before the elections. Ikechukwu Ani, spokesperson of the PSC, told TheCable that the IGP made a recommendation on the matter to the commission. Ani said the commission is expected to consider the recommendation. “I’m aware that there is a recommendation with the commission from the IGP, which the commission will consider,” the PSC spokesperson said. The letter said the posting was part of the plan to strengthen the strategic and operational control of Lagos and Ogun commands. “I am directed to humbly write and forward the proposed posting of the under-mentioned commissioners of police to state commands indicated against their names for the commission’s kind consideration and approval,” the letter reads. “The inspector-general of police is deploying the under-mentioned commissioners of police to strengthen the strategic and operational control of the commands.” Mba, prior to his posting to Ogun, was the commissioner of police in charge of the border patrol force, Force Headquarters, Abuja. Owohunwa was the principal staff officer of the IGP.
