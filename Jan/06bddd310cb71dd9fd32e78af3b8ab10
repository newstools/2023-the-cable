Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), visited the internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in Wassa, federal capital territory (FCT), on Sunday. Obi, who was accompanied by Margaret, his wife, shared the news on his Twitter page. He also urged Nigerians to remain united in efforts to move the country away from corruption and insecurity. ”I call on all Nigerians to unite our efforts in the journey of taking back our nation from the cold hands of corruption, insecurity and unproductivity,” he wrote. “2023 is a very critical year that will determine the next direction of our nation.”. Today, New Year’s Day 2023, I visited displaced Nigerians in the IDP camp in Wassa, FCT. These IDPs, unlike most Nigerians, cannot enjoy the New Year in the safety of their homes. They were forced to abandon their homes due to the perversive insecurity. pic.twitter.com/h4ghxsaBA0 — Peter Obi (@PeterObi) January 1, 2023  Below are pictures.
