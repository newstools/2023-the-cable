The supreme court has dismissed an appeal by the family of Sani Abacha seeking to stop the federal government from reopening criminal forfeiture proceedings against the former head of state. Delivering judgment on Friday, the apex court, led by Emmanuel Agim, upheld the judgments of both the federal high court and the court of appeal. Both courts had earlier endorsed the power of the federal government to reopen criminal forfeiture proceedings against the family. The court dismissed the suit for lack of merit and substance. The appeal marked: SC/641/2013 was filed by Mohammed, the eldest surviving son of Abacha, and his brother, Abba. The probe by the government is targeted at family members over their alleged complicity in looting the nation’s treasury during Abacha’s administration. Listed as respondents are the attorney-general of the federation (AGF), the inspector-general of police (IGP), DCP P. Y. Hana (chairman, special investigation panel), the national security adviser (NSA) and Sonja Nachbaur of the Principality of Liechtenstein.
