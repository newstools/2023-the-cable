The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says it has recorded six successful bids for forfeited real estate assets. Wilson Umujaren, EFCC spokesperson, announced the development in a statement on Tuesday. Uwujaren said 12 properties situated in Lagos were initially offered for sale through competitive bidding. However, at the end of the bidding exercise, the bids for six properties were successful. He said the bids for the remaining six properties were unsuccessful on grounds of non-compliance with the guidelines or the highest falling short of the reserve price.  “Six bidders today, January 10, 2023, emerged winners of different properties as the sale of forfeited real estate assets by Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, through sealed bids, entered the second day in Abuja,” the statement reads. “At today’s session, 12 properties in Lot 4, located in highbrow areas of Ikoyi and Lekki peninsula of Lagos were offered for sale through competitive bidding. At the end of the exercise, the bid for six properties were successful, while those in respect of the remaining six properties were unsuccessful on grounds of non-compliance with the guidelines or the highest bid falling short of the reserve price. “The properties listed serially in the Lot as numbers 4, 7, 8, 9 10, and 12 in respect of which no bid was successful, were re-opened to fresh bids until Friday, January 13, 2023, with the exception of the properties listed as numbers 9 and 12, which bid opening are slated for Monday, January 16, 2023. “Over 90 bidders participated in today’s exercise. One of the bid winners, Olaore Adebayo, commended the transparency of the exercise. “I want to thank the EFCC for this opportunity.
