Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says if voted into power, his administration will govern the country with the fear of God. Speaking during his party’s presidential campaign rally in Osogbo, Osun’s capital, Obi urged Nigerians to vote for candidates based on their competence and capacity not because of their ethnicity or religion. The LP candidate said he and Datti Baba-Ahmed, his running mate, are well-positioned to boost the economy of the country, adding that they’ve been successful businessmen before joining politics. The former governor of Anambra said the structures put in place by parties who have ruled the country have crippled the nation’s development. “Nigerians are hungry, youths have no job. It is not safe to travel anywhere in Nigeria today. All these challenges are caused by those who say they have party structures. But these structures have crippled Nigeria,” Obi said. “I want me and you to destroy these structures by voting them out next month. We are going to secure and unite Nigeria. We want Nigeria to be proud of being a Nigerian. “We will deliver a secured Nigeria. We don’t want Nigerians to be in the IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) camp. We don’t want you to be a slave in your own country. “We are going to govern this country with fear of God. We will give you jobs. We will change Nigeria from a consuming country to producing country. “These people kept on bragging that they have structures. Yet, they are not doing anything. They are not producing anything in this state, youths are unemployed, and we will change these challenges.”
