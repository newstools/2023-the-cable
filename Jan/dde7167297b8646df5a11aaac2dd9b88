The ministry of youth and sports development has resolved to raise a committee to immediately commence a review following complaints received over the medals table after the recent National Sports Festival (NSF) in Asaba, Delta state. There have been complaints from different quarters over alleged results padding, with some states claiming the total results cannot be up to the final medals table. In a statement on Sunday, the ministry said the review was normal to ascertain the challenges being encountered with the festival’s medals table computation. “Accordingly, the Ministry has appointed a five-man committee made up of experts who had managed the technical arm of previous sports festivals,” the statement reads. “Brig. Gen. Emmanuel Okaro will be Chairman of the committee, which also has Mrs. Hauwa-Kulu Akinyemi and Madaki Elias Gora as members. A representative of the Delta state Sports Commission will serve as member while Lekan Alabi, the statistician of the ministry, will be Secretary.” The statement said the committee, which was given seven days to submit its report, would determine what went wrong with the medals table computation from the standpoint of knowledge and experience of previous festivals. It added that the committee would establish the exact and correct medals table by ridding it of any double entries and inaccuracies as well as make recommendations to guide against future occurrence.
