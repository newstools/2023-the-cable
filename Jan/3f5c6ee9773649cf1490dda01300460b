Uba Sani, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna, says he will concentrate more on rural area development if elected. Sani said this on Monday at a meeting with stakeholders in the southern Kaduna senatorial zone in Kafanchan area of the state. He had earlier promised to empower women and ensure gender inclusion if elected governor. Speaking on Monday, Sani also said if elected, he would ensure youths are empowered through skill acquisition programmes. The governorship candidate, who is the senator representing Kaduna south, said all urban renewal projects will be completed, adding that “I will build roads, schools, and modern facilities as governor of Kaduna state”. He also urged stakeholders to award scholarships to students in the state, adding that education is not the sole responsibility of the government. Speaking on security issues, Sani asked political leaders not to turn insecurity into politics, adding that “anyone that tells you that he will address insecurity is not telling you the truth”. While criticising members of opposition parties in Kaduna who are in the national assembly for “doing nothing”, Sani said he has sponsored a constitution amendment bill for state police and for vigilantes to work with security operatives. “As a lawmaker, I have sponsored a constitution amendment bill advocating for state police. The issue is now with state assemblies and it is taking time,” he said. “I sponsored a bill advocating that vigilantes should be allowed to work with security agents. The bill has been passed in the senate, and it is now with the house of representatives. “Likewise, the candidate of the NNPP was in the senate for four years but he has no single bill to his credit. The Labour Party candidate was also in the house of representatives but he has no bill to his name.”
