Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says he will end insecurity and poverty if elected. Obi said this on Monday during his party’s presidential campaign rally at the Muhammadu Dikko stadium in Katsina. The LP candidate said if elected president, he will work towards ensuring the well-being of citizens. “Nigerians have been deceived for the past 24 years. I want to urge you to vote for the Labour Party in the forthcoming elections. We have come with the promise of ending the bloodshed, and poverty, and restoring peace in all parts of this country,” Obi said. Obi and Datti Baba-Ahmed, his running mate, also attended a town hall meeting with women and students drawn from various universities in the state. The LP candidates said it is time for change in the country, adding that they are committed to building a new Nigeria. “We want to build a Nigeria where there will be security of lives and property; nobody will be in IDP camp; your children will be secured and they will be in school. I will seek your support for that,” Obi said. “You have been deceived for the past 24 years, that’s what we want to change. Let’s have a new Nigeria.” In his remarks, Datti Baba-Ahmed said the LP has all it takes to tackle the challenges troubling the country. “All issues bedeviling the country have come to an end. We will hold your hands to say bye-bye to poverty, unnecessary killings, and kidnapping,” Baba-Ahmed said. “Job opportunities will be available; the economy will be improved and strengthened. As you can see the condition of poverty and hunger you were sunk into, we are the ones who know how to rescue you.”
