Phrank Shaibu, an aide of Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says Bola Tinubu is using petrol scarcity and the naira redesign as excuses for his imminent defeat. While speaking at a rally in Ogun state, Tinubu, standard bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC),  said the scarcity of petrol and change of the naira’s design would not affect his chances of securing victory. “This election is a revolution. They said fuel will be expensive — will be N200, N500. Put your mind at rest, we will bring it down,” the former Lagos governor had said. “They don’t want the election to hold. They want to disrupt it. Will you allow that? Will you vote?” In a statement on Wednesday, Shaibu said Tinubu is running from “pillar to post” despite claiming that he installed President Muhammadu Buhari in office. “Frustrated by President Muhammadu Buhari’s unwillingness to attend some of his insipid rallies, Tinubu launched an attack against the president who doubles as the minister of petroleum,” he said. “It is funny that Tinubu is just commenting over the fuel scarcity which started in different parts of the country as far back as February 2022. In Lagos, where Tinubu claims to be the landlord, the state has been witnessing fuel queues since last November. “It is therefore dubious of Tinubu to try to extricate himself from the failures of his party because elections are 30 days away. “Having seen his imminent defeat at the polls, he is already using the fuel scarcity and naira redesign as excuses. Tinubu should throw in the towel or get ready to be disgraced on February 25, 2023. “A word is enough for the wise.”
