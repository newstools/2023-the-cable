Yakubu Ajaka, deputy national spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says his party will win the governorship election in Bauchi state. In a statement on Monday, Ajaka said Bala Mohammed, governor of Bauchi, should prepare his handover notes for Abubakar Sadique, APC governorship candidate in the state. “By February 25th 2023 presidential election, it will dawn on the PDP elements in Bauchi that it is already over,” he said. “I want to assure the people of Bauchi state and Nigerians that the state specifically would witness another success story by bringing back the government of the APC under the leadership of Alhaji Sadique Abubakar. “The PDP-led government in Bauchi state should be preparing its handover notes by now because the APC is winning both the presidency for Asiwaju and governorship election for Sadique Abubakar by a landslide.” Ajaka said Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the APC, is known to be a “promise keeper”. “Tinubu is a promise keeper and he will keep to his promise with the state and the party members if given the opportunity,” he said. “He won’t forget this show of love which he received today in Bauchi during our presidential campaign rally.” The deputy spokesperson added that Sadique played a vital role in degrading insurgents when he was the chief of air staff.
