Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says his experience as a trader will provide the necessary solutions to Nigeria’s challenges. According to a statement by the Obi/Datti media office, the LP candidate said this on Wednesday during an interaction with some youths. Obi said he became a banker by “accident” following his time as a student of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN). He said Nigeria is at a stage where it requires a leader to negotiate it out of its problems, adding that being a trader equips you to face any challenge including that of governance. “Everything about governance is trading. The negotiation and all the bilateral talks with and between countries, agencies, contractors, or workers are trading and governance requires a good trader who can negotiate well,” Obi said. “Where we are in this country now requires a leader to negotiate us out of our problems. When I say I will negotiate with agitators, it’s from my background that you must accommodate everybody into your shop whether he is buying or not and decipher who is a customer and a passerby. “Even in my passport, it’s shown that I am a trader, but some said I should be a banker because I was the chairman of a bank. But I became a banker by accident. “My love is in trading because in it, you are equipped to face any challenges including governance.”
