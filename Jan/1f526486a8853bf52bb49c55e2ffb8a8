The supreme court has abridged the time to hear an appeal filed by Peter Nwaoboshi, senator representing Delta north district, challenging his imprisonment over money laundering. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had arraigned Nwaoboshi and his two firms – Golden Touch Construction Project Ltd and Suiming Electrical Ltd — in 2018 before Mohammed Idris, a judge who was later elevated to the court of appeal. They were then re-arraigned before Chukwujekwu Aneke on October 5, 2018. In the two-count charge marked FHC/L/117C/18, the EFCC alleged that the defendants laundered N322 million in 2014. While dismissing the case, Aneke had said the anti-graft agency failed to prove the elements of the offences for which it charged the senator. However, EFCC had appealed the judgment and the senator was sentenced to prison in July 2022. Consequently, Nwaoboshi lodged an appeal before the supreme court. The apex court had fixed November 24, 2024, to hear the appeal. But Nwaoboshi, through his counsel, Kanu Agabi, a senior advocate of NIgeria, filed an application seeking an earlier date to hear his appeal. Agabi noted that his client is a serving senator, who is also contesting in the 2023 general election. He also added that his client may suffer the fate of completing his jail term but later have his innocence proven. The EFCC did not oppose the application. In a ruling, a five-member panel of the apex court led by Olukayode Ariwoola, chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), shortened the hearing date. The hearing has now been fixed for February 9.
