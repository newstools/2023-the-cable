The farmers — mostly youths — were on their way to Samanaji, a riverine community in the area, when the incident occurred. TheCable had earlier reported that ten bodies were recovered on Wednesday. About 80 passengers have been rescued, and a total of 14 persons have been confirmed dead, while six others are yet to be found. According to NAN, Atiku Bagudu, governor of Kebbi, alongside Abubakar Malami, minister of justice, visited the area on Thursday to condole with the members of the community. Bagudu prayed for the farmers who lost their lives and warned boat operators against overloading and travelling at night. “I am here with a top delegation to condole with you over the unfortunate boat mishap,” he said. “We pray to God to forgive all who lost their lives and we pray for the recovery of the missing ones.” Yahaya Bello, chairman of the council, commended the governor for his compassion towards the families of the victims. Bello assured that the search and rescue operation is ongoing to save more passengers. He thanked Nasir Idris, governorship candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), for the N5 million donation to the families of those who lost their lives.
