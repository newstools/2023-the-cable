Rabiu Kwankwaso, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), says if elected, his administration will build 500,000 classrooms for out-of-school children. He said this on Monday during the inauguration of the NNPC’s presidential campaign council (PCC), in Abuja. Kwankwaso also said his administration will ensure tertiary institutions are upgraded to global standards. “Let me remind us that we are determined to reform the education sector to improve quality and access at all levels,” he said. “Specifically, we will provide 500,000 classrooms across the states of the federation to accommodate the over 20 million out-of-school children that we plan to mop up from the streets of Nigeria. “We will make all application forms for admission and employment free; we will make all examinations such as WAEC, NECO, NABTEB, NBIAS, JAMB, etc., free. “We will upgrade and expand all our universities, polytechnics, and colleges of education and raise their standard to global competitiveness.” The party also unveiled a fundraising portal to support its presidential campaign.
