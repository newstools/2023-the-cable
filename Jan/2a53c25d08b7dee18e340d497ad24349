The Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) says it would partner with uLesson Education for the 4th PWC/NCF National Under 17 Cricket Championship billed for next month in Abuja. The announcement comes ahead of the zonal qualifiers for the National U-17 Cricket Championship scheduled to begin on January 20. Emeka Igwillo, general manager of the NCF, said the partnership would boost the annual competition which he said has achieved a massive impact since its inception. “We as a federation are working hard at evolving new strategies every year towards achieving our target for talent discovery and we believe uLesson would serve our purpose,” Igwillo said. More than 850 players participated in the regional qualifiers last year and the NCF’s general manager believes there would be bigger participation in the latest edition. “We are pleased with the developmental work being done by our officers and coaches across the states and we look forward to the regional events with optimism in terms of large participation,” he said. Iheanyi Akwitti, senior vice president, academics and curriculum at uLesson, said the partnership is aimed to produce well-rounded young people as well as help them to attain their goals through sports. “Through our partnership with many schools, we have contributed to programmes like The Middle Stump’s Greenshoots Summer Camp which has seen over 1,200 young boys and girls introduced to cricket,” Akwitti said. Oluwafemi Fadipe, vice president, marketing at uLesson, said: “Cricket has shown itself as being organised and deliberate about its developmental plans. We are aware that the cricket federation has targeted reaching out to 250,000 kids yearly across the country and we believe our partnership would enable us to build a better and assured future.”
