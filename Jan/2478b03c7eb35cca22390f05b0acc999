The women’s wing of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council on Tuesday held its rally in Imo. The rally was held at the Ndubuisi Kanu square, Owerri, the capital. The campaign train was led by Oluremi Tinubu, senator representing Lagos central and wife of Bola Tinubu,  APC presidential candidate. The campaign team was received by Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo. Speaking at the event, the lawmaker said if her husband is elected “women will have a seat at the table”. “We will deliver on all we have promised Nigerians and even more. I am a pastor and a deaconess. My husband has supported me all the way in my religion. Nigeria is beyond religion or tribe,” she said. “We love the Igbos and we will do our best to bring prosperity to the east and give women all the support and employment they need. Women, this is your time, you will enjoy and have seats at the table.” The lawmaker said her husband has mentored many Nigerians irrespective of their ethnicity, religion, and gender. Also speaking, Chioma Uzodimma, wife of the governor and APC south-east coordinator said the people of the state are in support of Tinubu’s presidential bid. “This is the second time in three months that women in the east have come out to pledge support for the party. First, during the peaceful one million women march and now the women’s rally,” she said. The campaign train also visited the palace of Eze Imo. See the photos below:
