Pope Francis has asked for prayers for the late Isaac Achi, a priest of Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Kafin-Koro, Paikoro LGA of Niger state. Achi was burnt to death when gunmen attacked his residence on Sunday. The assailants also shot a colleague of the priest, identified as Father Collins, while he was attempting to escape. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Pope Francis asked for prayers on behalf of the late priest, adding that Christians continue to be a target of violence. “I ask all of you to join me in praying for Father Isaac Achi, of the Diocese of Minna in northern Nigeria, who was killed last Sunday in an attack on his rectory,” the pope said. “So many Christians continue to be the target of violence. Let us #PrayTogether for them.” I ask all of you to join me in praying for Father Isaac Achi, of the Diocese of Minna in northern Nigeria, who was killed last Sunday in an attack on his rectory.

For a priest to be killed in such a manner means that we are not all safe. These terrorists have lost it, and drastic action is needed to end this ongoing carnage,” he said. He condoled with the Christian community and the Catholic Church over the death of the priest and gave the assurance that the government will bring the perpetrators to book.
