The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has recommended the construction of barricades on the Ojuelegba bridge in Lagos in order to restrict the movement of articulated vehicles. Dauda Biu, FRSC corps marshal, said this on Sunday in a statement by Bisi Kazeem, the agency’s spokesperson. Earlier on Sunday, nine persons were killed after a container-laden truck fell on a bus at the Ojuelegba bridge. Speaking on the incident, Biu said the construction of barricades at the bridge will bring a permanent solution to the reoccurring crashes in the area. “Whilst his concerns stem from the reoccurring container crashes on Ojuelegba bridge that has claimed several lives, the Corps Marshal recommends the construction of barricades against articulated vehicles (Tankers, Trucks, Trailers and other heavy-duty vehicles) on Ojuelegba Bridge as a permanent solution to the reoccurring crashes,” the statement reads. “According to preliminary investigation conducted into the fatal crashes, the Ojuelegba crash involved a Mack Truck with a 40ft container with the registration number KJA 380 KD, who apart from engaging in excessive speed, also indulged in an act of wrongful overtaking and a Suzuki mini bus registered as KTU 921 YD; while the SOKA avoidable menace involved a Truck driven against traffic and a Marcopolo bus. “The container mounted on the Mack Truck at Ojuelegba, according to our operatives, fell off the truck and landed on the Suzuki mini bus filled up with passengers which obviously led to the death of 9 of the passengers.” Commenting on the Soka bridge incident, the corps marshal cautioned commuters against route violation, popularly known as one-way.
