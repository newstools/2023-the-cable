Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of sabotaging petrol supply in the country to blackmail the federal government. According to a statement by the Tinubu campaign team, the presidential candidate spoke on Thursday at the APC rally in Makurdi, Benue state. Since February 2022, Nigeria has witnessed extended periods of petroleum product scarcity, especially petrol. The scarcity has sparked disputes and blame-shifting between regulatory bodies and oil marketers. Tinubu said while in power, the PDP administration gave petrol retail licenses to their supporters who are now hoarding the product to create long queues across the country and make Nigerians suffer. “They met good oil prices for 16 good years, they didn’t remember gas pipelines, they are what I called saboteurs yesterday. They gave PMS licenses to their supporters and sympathisers. They are the ones who started creating fake queues. PDP, enough is enough,” he said. The presidential candidate said Atiku Abubakar, the standard bearer of the PDP, broke the civil service rule by “doing transport business” while he was in customs service. “They asked him, you are so rich, where did you get your money from, and he said from doing transport business. He didn’t know that was an offence. The only thing you are allowed to do as a civil servant is farming,” he said. Speaking further, Tinubu assured the youths in Benue that his administration would ensure access to quality education and education loans. He added that salaries would not be owed and that the problem of IDPs in the state will be solved. “I am proud of what we accomplished in Lagos. I am so proud of it, I do not run off to live elsewhere,” he said. “I live where my policies and programmes worked. Obi left Anambra because his policies and programmes failed. Just as we improved Lagos, we shall lead Nigeria to its greatest destiny.”
