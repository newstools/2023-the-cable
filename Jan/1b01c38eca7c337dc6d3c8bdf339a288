Bola Tinubu, standard bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has again taken a swipe at Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). While speaking on Monday at a campaign rally at Maidoki ground in Yola, capital city of Adamawa, Tinubu said Abubakar would privatise government enterprises and leave Nigerians “with nothing”. The former vice-president has always argued that privatisation of national assets is in the best interest of the country. But the former governor of Lagos said Adamawa residents should vote for him and not Abubakar if they want a better country. “I hear that a former VP who comes from Adamawa wants to return to Aso Villa again,” he said. “You have to decide whether you owe him your vote simply because he is from here or do you owe yourself a better nation and future? “If you believe a better tomorrow is possible, then you cannot support the [former] vice-president [to] privatise everything. If you give him the nation, he will sell all he can and leave you with nothing.” Tinubu also asked Adamawa residents to vote for Aisha Binani, the governorship candidate of the party in the state. “She is brilliant, driven and result-oriented. She will perform better for the state,” he said. The former governor said he has done his research and has “fashioned wise plans”, adding that “what I promise is real and achievable”. “I see adequate fresh produce storage facilities, farm-to-market roads, and access routes,” he said. “I also envision the establishment of commodity exchange boards and credit facilities that will provide the hardworking farmer a guaranteed income for his crops and also allow farmers affordable loans to invest in and improve the productive yield of their lands. “I can envision these good things for my people because I have the expertise and commitment to see them become reality.”
