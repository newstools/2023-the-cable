Margaret, wife of Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says there’s no better team to “turn Nigeria around” than her husband and Datti Baba-Ahmed, his running mate. Margaret said this on Tuesday while speaking at a town hall meeting in Abuja. She said if the LP candidate is elected president, women and youths will be well represented in government, adding that the time for complaining is over. “We are gathered here today because we are patriots who believe Nigeria is worth fighting for; our home that we must build with our hands. We are here because we believe that the nation is speeding downhill in the wrong direction, and now it is approaching a cliff into a deep dark abyss,” Margaret said. “Together, we must take action to turn the nation around and head it in the right direction. There is no better team to lead Nigeria at a time like this than Peter Obi and Senator Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed. “Women make up 49% of the Nigerian population, and by June this year, women and youth already made up over 75% of the registered voters in Nigeria. Why then should we suffer in silence? This is why we are making this call to women, you can and must empower the nation to birth a new Nigeria. “When things go bad, women are the ones that suffer the most. I therefore encourage you to look at what the candidates have to offer you as women. Look at their track record and then vote accordingly. “From access to finance to healthcare, and also economic empowerment and inclusive government, the ObiDatti policies show women that a new Nigeria where women take their rightful place is possible. The ObiDatti government is committed to ensuring that women and youth will be represented in government by law. Not a token sprinkling of women. “The time for complaining is over. God has presented us with a unique opportunity and we must do our part as women, mothers of the nation, to truly birth the Nigeria we want to see.”
