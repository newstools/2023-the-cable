Haliru Bello, a former national chairperson of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has suffered paralysis and cannot walk. Duncan Oluohu, his lawyer, told a federal high court in Abuja that the former PDP chairperson suffered a stroke following the death of his son, Abba Muhammed Bello. “He is currently paralysed and can’t walk. That is why he is not in court today,” Oluohu said. Abba, who was the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Birnin Kebbi/Kalgo/Bunza federal constituency of Kebbi state, died on January 6. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had arraigned Abba in 2016 alongside his father and a firm, Bam Projects and Property Ltd, on a four-count charge over an alleged N300 million fraud. At the resumed trial on Tuesday, Akeem Bakare, who announced an appearance for the second defendant (Bam Projects and Property Ltd), informed the court about the death of the first defendant. He said Abba’s death has caused the health of the third defendant to deteriorate. He said a copy of the death certificate has been handed to the prosecution. Oluwaleke Atolagbe, the prosecution counsel, acknowledged receipt of the first defendant’s death certificate. He commiserated with the deceased’s family and his lawyers and prayed the court to strike out Abba’s name from the charge. The prosecution counsel also sought an adjournment for the continuation of the trial of the remaining defendants. Since the lawyers of the defendants did not object, Ahmed Mohammed, the presiding judge, adjourned till March 28 for continuation.
