Nwankwo Kanu, former Super Eagles forward, says he did not endorse any candidate contesting for president. In a video posted on his Twitter page on Friday, Kanu urged Nigerians to regard claims of his endorsement of any candidate as “fake, wicked news”. An old clip of the former footballer praising Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), had recently gone viral. In the video, which was captured in March 2022 during a visit to commemorate Tinubu’s 70th birthday, Kanu recounted that the APC candidate was one of the first donors to his foundation when it stated. Supporters of the APC presidential candidate had interpreted the video as the former Arsenal FC player pledging his support for Tinubu. Addressing the situation, Kanu said he is not a politician and warned purveyor of the claims to “not try to destroy what you cannot destroy”. “I have said it and I will say it again. I am not a politician but a footballer. Whoever is spreading fake news that I asked you to vote for somebody,” the ex-international said. “I do not do such. My life is all about football. That is my field and I am proud of it. This is the last time: stop spreading fake, wicked news against Papilo. I am here to help people. Do not try to destroy what you cannot destroy.” Kanu called on Nigerians to get their PVCs and” “vote for the best” to “make Nigeria better”.
