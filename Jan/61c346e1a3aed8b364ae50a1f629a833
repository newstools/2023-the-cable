Festus Keyamo, spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council, says talks around the health status of Bola Tinubu are a “waste of time”. Keyamo spoke while appearing on Arise TV’s morning show on Monday. Tinubu has been under scrutiny over his health status since he became the presidential candidate of the APC. He has suffered a number of gaffes at campaign rallies and the mistakes have raised concerns over his fitness for office. Keyamo however said the errors were caused by “tiredness of the campaign trail” and not failing health. He said the presidential candidates of other leading parties have also suffered similar “slips of the tongue”. “I have not seen anything that has happened to Tinubu on the campaign trail that has not happened to other candidates,” he said. “Slip of tongue here and there, it has happened to Atiku and Obi. The PDP spokesperson and their candidates have asked Nigeria to vote for APC even far more than APC has asked Nigerians to vote for APC. “What has happened to my candidate? Has he fainted or collapsed? Nothing has happened to him. For me to spend five minutes talking about a health issue that does not exist is an absolute waste of time. “In terms of the tiredness of the campaign trail, all candidates — young or old — when you stump from place to place once in a while you make little gaffes.” Keyamo said Tinubu is healthy and has been more active in campaign rallies than other presidential candidates.
