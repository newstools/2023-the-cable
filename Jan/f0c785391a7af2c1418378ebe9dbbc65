Fulham scored once in both halves to overcome Chelsea 2-1 in their English Premier League (EPL) match at Craven Cottage on Thursday night. It was another miserable night for Chelsea who had Joao Felix, the latest recruit who joined Graham Potter’s side on loan on Wednesday, sent off on his debut. William, ex-Chelsea player, came back to haunt the Stamford Bridge side in the London Derby encounter in which Carlos Vinicius scored the winning goal. Kalidou Koulibaly scored Chelsea’s only goal, which was not enough to secure any point. Despite the absence of Alexander Mitrovic, William gave Fulham the lead on 25 minutes with a shot that deflected off Trevor Chalobah into the net. Chelsea had 12 shots in the first half and had to wait until the start of the second period to level the match, with Koulibaly stabbing in the loose ball after Mason Mount’s free kick hit the post. Felix got his marching order on 58 minutes after a poor challenge in which the Portuguese lunged in with a high boot. The 23-year-old became the first-ever Chelsea player to get sent off on his debut. Fulham improved to sixth position on the EPL log with 31 points from 19 matches, while Chelsea are stuck in midtable with 25 points from 18 matches.
