The Lagos government says it has taken steps to regulate the activities of major and independent petroleum marketers operating along traffic-prone areas and roads within the state. Frederic Oladeinde, Lagos commissioner for transportation, said this in a statement on Thursday. He said the move became imperative in order to check the indiscriminate activities of motorists queuing to buy petroleum products and oftentimes impeding the free flow of traffic on some roads. Oladeinde explained that petroleum marketers whose filling stations are situated on major highways and areas susceptible to traffic, will henceforth be allowed to operate only between the hours of 9 am to 4 pm daily, pending when the petrol shortage crisis subsides. He added that the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Vehicle Inspection Service (VIS), Transport Operations Compliance Unit (TOCU) and other law enforcement agencies have been charged to ensure a seamless flow of traffic across the state. The commissioner, therefore, implored all major and independent petroleum marketers operating across the state to comply with the directive to avoid sanctions. The state directive follows the lingering petrol scarcity across the country, which has impacted commuters as well as business owners. The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) had said there is no end in sight yet, projecting that the scarcity may continue until June.
