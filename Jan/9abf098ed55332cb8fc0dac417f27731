The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has disowned a website advertising ad-hoc staff positions for the 2023 general election. In September, INEC unveiled a portal for the recruitment of ad hoc staff such as supervisory presiding officers, presiding officers, assistant presiding officers, and registration area technicians, for the 2023 elections. The commission said the online portal for the applications would open on September 14 at 8 am and close on December 14 at 8 pm. But on Tuesday, a website looking like that of  INEC asked applicants to register for all categories of ad-hoc positions. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Rotimi Oyekanmi, chief press secretary to INEC chairman, said the website was created with the intention to defraud the general public and, therefore, asked Nigerians to disregard it. “The website/blog is advertising ad-hoc staff positions for the 2023 General Election,” the statement reads. “However, the commission is no longer recruiting ad-hoc staff for the 2023 general election. The INEC ad-hoc staff recruitment portal was officially shut down on 14th December 2022. “Therefore, the site, with the URL – http://www.yournewclaims.com/Inec-Recriutment/ is fake. It is intended to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. Nigerians should disregard it.”
