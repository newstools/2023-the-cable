The All Progressives Congress (APC) says the viral report claiming Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi, has withdrawn his support for Bola Tinubu, standard bearer of the party, is false. The ruling party was reacting to a media report that claimed Bello has “tactically” withdrawn his support for the former Lagos governor. In a statement on Sunday, Felix Morka, APC spokesperson, described the report as “a figment of the imagination of its author and sponsors”. “Yahaya Bello, who serves as the national youth coordinator of the Tinubu-Shettima presidential campaign council, is a solid, resourceful and committed campaigner for our party’s candidate, leading a massively successful outreach to youth voters across the country,” Morka said. “This fake news, ostensibly intended to float an imagined rift between Yahaya Bello and James Faleke, secretary of the APC presidential campaign council, is the desperate and disgraceful conjecture of opposition elements unsettled by our party’s giant campaign strides. “Both loyal party men are unquestionably committed and working tirelessly for the resounding victory of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in next month’s presidential election. “We urge our party compatriots and all Nigerians to disregard this fake news.” In a post on his official Twitter handle, on Sunday, Bello said his support for the APC candidate is undiluted. FAKE NEWS ALERT Kindly disregard every fake news being spread by mischievous media outlets. My unwavering support for Tinubu/Shettima 2023 is  % undiluted. God bless APC!!! God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria ! pic.twitter.com/UfWB5D2abc — Alhaji Yahaya Bello (@OfficialGYBKogi) January 22, 2023
