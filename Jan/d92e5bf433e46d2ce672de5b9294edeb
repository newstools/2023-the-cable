The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says the signing of an undertaking is compulsory for candidates and all parties involved in the conduct of the 2023 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Ishaq Oloyede, JAMB registrar, announced this during an interactive session with media executives in Lagos on Sunday. Oloyede said the initiative, which also applies to registration for Direct Entry (DE), is aimed at curbing infractions in the system. He said permanent staff of the board, adhoc staff, CBT centres, service providers, and other partners are required to sign the undertaking before being engaged by JAMB for the exercise. The JAMB registrar added that candidates must also sign the undertaking before completing their registration for UTME/DE. According to him, the undertaking for candidates is aimed at ensuring applicants provide accurate information during registration for UTME/DE. Listing the consequences for infractions during the process, Oloyede said candidates may be barred from sitting for the board’s examinations for up to three years. He added that “names of defaulters may be published by the board in daily national newspapers and as well circulated to other public examination bodies”. “Defaulting “candidate may be handed to the EFCC, ICPC, or the Nigerian Police for prosecution.” The JAMB registrar said the board has taken other measures ahead of this year’s UTME/DE, including reducing the number of approved computer-based test (CBT) centres. “There is a radical reduction in the number of approved CBT centres. Last year we had 753 approved CBT centres and only 613 of 850 centres which applied scaled through the accreditation,” he said. He further said there is also a fall in the number of ad-hoc staff needed for this year’s UTME. “140 reduction in centre means 1,400 of the staff engaged last year will not be so engaged,” he said.
