The commission said it lost only 41 cases in 2022, which indicates that a 98.93 percent success rate was achieved.

This shot to 195 convictions in 2016, the first full year in office of the Buhari administration. “The figure improved to 312 in 2018, 1,280 in 2019, dropped slightly to 976 convictions in 2020, the year of COVID-19, then moved up to 2,220 in 2021. “The percentile improvement of the EFCC convictions in the seven years of the Buhari administration from 103 to 3785, is over 3574.8%.”
