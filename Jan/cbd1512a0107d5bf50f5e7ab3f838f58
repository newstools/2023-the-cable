Abdullahi Sule, governor of Nasarawa, says he sees his son’s death as a “test from God”. He said this on Friday while receiving condolence visits at the palace of Sule Bawa, his father who is also the Sarkin Gudi in Akwanga LGA. Hassan, son to the Nasarawa governor, died on Thursday. He was 36 years old. Speaking on Friday, Sule said he consoled someone who lost nine family children  in the recent airstrike that occurred in the state, adding that he could not question God’s decision on his son’s death. “I see this as a test from God. I was the person consoling somebody that lost his nine children and 70 cows yesterday, and today, God decided to test me, to see whether I was sincere in consoling that bereaved father,” the governor said. Sule described the late Hassan as a respectful person who always wanted the best for his family. “He grew up carrying all his siblings along. It’s only God that has the power to take him away. He was the one taking decisions on our businesses. He was always on hand to advise me on what next to do, saying my schedule would not allow me to run any business,” he said. “God took him away to test my resilience and faith. God didn’t seek my advice when he gave Hassan to me and he will not seek my advice when he takes him away.”
