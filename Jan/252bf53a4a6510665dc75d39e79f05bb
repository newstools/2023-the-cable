The Imo police command says it has arrested three suspected armed robbers in Rivers. In a statement on Friday released by Henry Okoye, the state police spokesperson said a red Toyota corolla 2007 model with registration number WER330AJ was recovered from the suspects who fled to Rivers. He said the command received a distress call from Uchenna Ohia, a victim who runs a pharmacy business. “Six armed men stormed his pharmacy at Works Layout, Owerri, robbed him, his customers, and staff of their belongings, kidnapped him at the scene, locked him up in the booth of his car, and zoomed off,” Okoye said. “The command’s quick Intervention Team swiftly swung into action, activating all the strategies to track down the hoodlums. “This paid off on 23rd January 2023, when through credible intelligence, the vehicle was traced to Matel Bott Fuel Station, Rumuokoro in Obiakpo LGA of Rivers state, where the vehicle was recovered as three suspects arrested.” The three male suspects were identified as Ogbonna Vincent, 27, Ejike John, 30, and Ikemba Joesh, 28. Okoye said the investigation was still ongoing and that the suspects would be charged in court at the conclusion of the investigation. Mohammed Ahmed, the state commissioner of police, assured Imo residents of the command’s efforts to curtail insecurity in the state to the barest minimum. He urged citizens to report any suspicious activities to the police for prompt action.
