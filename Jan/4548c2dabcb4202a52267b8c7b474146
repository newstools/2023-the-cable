Gunmen have reportedly attacked the Afor Atta divisional police headquarters in Njaba LGA of Imo state. The police station was said to have been attacked on Monday night, but no officer was on duty when the incident happened. According to Punch, a source said the residents of the community couldn’t come out because of fear, and that the area is deserted. Michael Abattam, the Imo police spokesperson, did not respond to calls or messages when contacted on the incident. The attack on the police station comes amid several attacks in Imo over the past months, which have resulted in killings, abductions, and destruction of property. On Monday, four police officers were killed during an attack on the convoy of Ikedi Ohakim, a former governor of Imo state. The incident was said to have happened at Oriagu in Ehime Mbano LGA of Imo state. In December 2022, a magistrate court  in Owerri LGA and a high court in Orlu LGA of Imo state were set ablaze by gunmen within the space of 24 hours. Also in December 2022, gunmen killed Christopher Eleghu, the candidate of the Labour Party (LP) for Onuimo constituency in the Imo state house of assembly. On December 12, gunmen attacked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) head office in Owerri, the Imo capital. The gunmen attacked the INEC building with locally-made explosives, but the police officers stationed at the office were said to have confronted the gunmen, killing three persons in the process. A section of the INEC facility in Owerri was, however, razed.
