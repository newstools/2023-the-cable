Bandits have reportedly abducted four students while returning from a friend’s wedding along Kaura Namoda and Birnin Magaji roads in Zamfara. The victims who were said to be students of the College of Health Technology, Tsafe, had reportedly attended the wedding alongside three of their siblings who were also abducted. The incident was said to have occurred on Sunday. Mohammed Shehu, Zamfara police spokesperson, confirmed some persons were abducted along Kaura Namoda and Birnin Magaji road on Sunday. Shehu said he could not confirm if there were students among the abducted commuters as no report has been received from the family members or school authority. “I know we had an incident on Sunday where bandits blocked the road and kidnapped some commuters but on the issue of whether there are students or not, we don’t have that report because none of the family members or the school authority have reported the incident to the police indicating that their students or siblings were abducted,” he told TheCable. “All we know is that there was an incident of abduction along that road and the victims are unknown but we have a report of abduction along Birnin Magaji and Kaura Namoda on Sunday. “Maybe the family members are communicating with the bandits there but as far as the police are concerned, none of the family members have reported to the police. Whether there are students or not, we do not know. “This is the true version of the story. There was an abduction, we received that report and the commissioner of police mobilised a tactical team of search and rescue operation to ensure that the victims are rescued hale and hearty. “If we had received information from the family members or school authority, that is then we will say yes, students were abducted but we are not saying no student was abducted, we don’t know whether there are students among them because no report from the parent ot school authority was received.”
