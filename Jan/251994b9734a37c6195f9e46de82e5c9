Nimi Walson-Jack, former general secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), has protested his suspension from the association by NBA national executive committee. In a communique issued at its quarterly national executive committee meeting held on December 15 in Abuja, the NBA said it reached a resolution to suspend Walson-Jack for acting as a solicitor to the promoters of the Law Society of Nigeria (LSN), a parallel professional body of lawyers. While noting that it will sanction any member of the bar seeking to promote or register a new lawyers’ association, the NBA said it would commence a process to delist the LSN from the portal of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Faulting the process of his suspension via a statement, Walson-Jack said the NBA violated its constitution. “Both the process and substance of arriving at the resolution to sanction me have shown the NBA as being anti-Rule of Law and earned our previously esteemed association a place in the hall of infamy of dictators and anti-rule of law elements who abound in mushroom organizations across Nigeria and the World,” he said. “The leadership of the NBA, by its resolution, breached the constitution of the NBA, my fundamental right to a fair hearing, and the right of my clients to counsel of their choice. “The president of the NBA was the accuser, persecutor, prosecutor, and judge in his cause.” He added that the NBA-NEC “has no power to suspend, expel or remove a statutory member like me unless the constitution is amended, an exclusive preserve of the annual general meeting”. He further alleged that “the leadership of the bar led by and including senior advocates of Nigeria was blinded by dislike or hate of my person” in the resolution to suspend him.
