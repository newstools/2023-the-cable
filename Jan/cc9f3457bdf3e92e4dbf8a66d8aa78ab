Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, says the south-west is lucky to have Bola Tinubu as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking at a rally in Ondo central senatorial district on Monday, Akeredolu expressed confidence that Tinubu would win the presidential election in February. The governor said Nigerians should not look to the north for the next president of the country. “Tinubu will be elected as the president,” the governor said. “Should we be looking for someone else in Sokoto or Adamawa when we have a reliable and competent person amongst us? “We are lucky to have Asiwaju Tinubu in APC. He will win.” Earlier, Ade Adetimehin, chairman of the APC in Ondo, said voters should use their permanent voter cards (PVCs) as “weapons”. “From top to bottom, it must be APC. It is time for total loyalty. We have a Governor that we can be proud of. He’s a committed leader. He’s loyal to his words,” Adetimehin said. “If you look at his achievements, he’s a role model. On security in the south-west, he stood his ground and today we can sleep with our two eyes closed. “We are campaigning on Governor Akeredolu’s achievement. In terms of performance, nobody has performed better than Akeredolu since the creation of this state in terms of road infrastructure, school, health and so on.”
