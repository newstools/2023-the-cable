Abdullahi Sule, governor of Nasarawa, says the explosion in Kwateri, a community between the state and Benue, was not carried out by a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) aircraft. Sule who spoke during an Arise TV show on Wednesday said an unidentified “drone” carried out the attack. On Tuesday, at least 27 people were killed following an airstrike which hit some herders waiting to transport their cattle from an area that connects Benue to Nasarawa. The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) said the explosion happened after the herders went to get 1,250 of their cows impounded by the Benue livestock guards. The governor however dispelled the “rumours” that the attack was orchestrated by the air force. He said enquiries revealed that “no air force plane flew through the area,” adding that the bombing was done by a drone whose operators were yet to be identified. “It will be very difficult to arrest anyone at the moment because the whole place at that moment was in total disarray. The rumours earlier were that the air force carried out the bombing but right now, we understand that there was no air force plane that flew through the area,” the governor said. “It was a drone that flew through the area and dropped the bomb. I have spoken with all the security agencies around and all of them claim they do not know anything about it. Nobody is claiming responsibility for the drone bombing.” Sule said the investigation was still ongoing to ascertain the truth of the situation.
