Eight Arsenal fans have been arrested in Jinja, Uganda, for allegedly celebrating the club’s 3-2 win over Manchester United in the English Premier League (EPL). According to Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper, the jubilant fans were arrested on Monday after driving in a convoy of about five vehicles while allegedly celebrating across the city. The contingents were wearing the club’s red jersey and carrying a symbolic trophy. Arsenal scored a last-minute winner to earn a vital win over in-form Manchester United on Sunday. The win maintained Arsenal’s five-point lead at the summit of the EPL table with 50 points from 19 matches. Speaking on the arrest, Baker Kasule, who was part of the group, said they were just celebrating their team’s victory when they were matched to the police station. “I don’t know what we have done but we were simply celebrating our victory over rivals Manchester United,” Kasule said. However, James Mubi, spokesperson of Kira region Police, said the fans were apprehended for holding a procession without being cleared by security. He also claimed the group demonstrated a lack of basic knowledge about the club which cast doubts on their intentions. “We asked for the name of the Arsenal coach, the number of premier league teams, number of games Arsenal has so far played, number of wins and losses Arsenal have registered this season and the top-four teams but there was no answer,” Mubi was quoted as saying. “They don’t know anything about Arsenal. That’s why our issue wasn’t about them being Arsenal supporters.” It was gathered that all the arrested fans were released after spending the night at the police station.
