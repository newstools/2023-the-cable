Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto state, has urged youths to rebuff any offer to be used as political thugs during the elections. Tambuwal, director-general of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council, spoke on Tuesday at a campaign rally in Binji and Tangaza LGAs of Sokoto. The governor advised the youths to not allow themselves to be used to compromise peaceful coexistence by perpetrating violence and chaos. “You should ask any politician who invites you into political thuggery to align you with his sons and daughters,” he said. The governor said Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the PDP, is the only flagbearer that can change Nigeria’s political fortune positively. He said Abubakar has designed workable strategies to end banditry, fight corruption and unemployment, address infrastructural decay and boost the socio-economic life of Nigerians, among other issues. “Therefore, we should all give our votes for PDP candidates from the president to the state house of assembly in order to benefit the best Nigeria of our dreams,” he said. “We should safeguard our permanent voter cards and avoid any person who would use money to buy our votes for the best of our country’s future.” On his part, Sa’idu Umar, the PDP gubernatorial candidate, pledged to maintain the legacy and dynamic style of Tambuwal if elected.
