Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers state, says most Nigerians do not appreciate the roles played by the armed forces in the peaceful existence of the nation. The governor said this during the thanksgiving and inter-denominational service in commemoration of the 2023 Armed Forces Remembrance Day held on Sunday at the All Saint’s cathedral church of the Anglican communion in Obio-Akpor LGA, Rivers. In a statement by Kelvin Ebiri, the governor’s spokesperson, Wike said most Nigerians do not attach importance to the sacrifices of the men of the armed forces. The governor also highlighted the need for the federal government to establish a standing welfare fund, from which money can be accessed to cater for the families of fallen heroes and war veterans. “Each year the Armed Forces Remembrance Day celebrations begin with the emblem launch. After the launch, crests are usually made available that are meant to be worn daily, but most Nigerians do not attach importance to it,” the governor said. “Pinning such crests on shirts worn daily serves as a mark of honour and a way of identifying with the men and officers of the Armed Forces of Nigeria. “Refusing to wear them indicates a lack of appreciation of the sacrifices the officers have made in fighting to curtail insurrection, secession, crime and all forms of criminality that threaten the peace that makes a healthy country.”
