The Imo state police command says it has arrested three suspected members of Eastern Security Network (ESN) who attacked a vigilante group in the state. The ESN is the paramilitary organisation of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). According to a statement on Thursday by Michael Abattam, the police command public relations officer, the suspects were involved in the burning of the offices of Agwa central vigilante group. Abattam said the gunmen were accosted while proceeding to attack the Agwa police station in Oguta LGA of the state. “Sequel to the command’s determination to curb the menace of terrorism in the state, the command swiftly responded to a distress call that hoodlums suspected to be members of Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network (ESN) had attacked Agwa Central Vigilante Group, burning down their offices while proceeding to attack the Agwa police station,” the statement reads. “Our men professionally engaged the bandits in a fierce gun duel and in the process, three of the hoodlums were arrested while others scampered for safety into the adjoining bushes with various degrees of gunshot wounds, abandoning their three operational vehicles. “The three suspects are cooling off in our custody as our gallant operatives are not relenting in their efforts to apprehend the fleeing hoodlums.” Abattam said two pump actions guns, two double barrels, 24 rounds of live ammunition, 12 expended cartridges, one improvised explosive device, three operational vehicles, an iron box, a travelling bag, and assorted charms were recovered from the suspects.
