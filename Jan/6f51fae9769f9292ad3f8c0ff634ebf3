The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has praised the decision of a federal capital territory (FCT) high court for refusing to sack Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). One Emmanuel Agonsi had asked the court for an injunction compelling Yakubu to step aside from office pending the conclusion of a probe against the INEC chairperson over alleged false asset declaration. In the suit marked FCT/HC/GAR/CV/47/2022, Agonsi also asked the court to bar the INEC chairman from holding office for the next 10 years. But the court threw out the case on grounds that there was nothing wrong with the asset declaration form of Yakubu. In a chat with reporters on Wednesday, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, CUPP spokesperson, said the judiciary has proven to be the last hope of the common man. “I’m happy that the judiciary over the months has proven that they are the last hope of the common man,” Ugochinyere said. “Since our intelligence discovery of plans to compel the INEC chairman to stop the use of Bimodal Voter Accreditation system in the 2023 elections, these evil politicians have not rested, they are looking for nonexisting faults. “First, it was the CBN governor because of the cash limit policy, and now, the INEC chairman. “The security agencies are a disappointment. At a time the masses need their protection and help the most, they are busy collecting bribes and serving the interest of the evil politicians.”
