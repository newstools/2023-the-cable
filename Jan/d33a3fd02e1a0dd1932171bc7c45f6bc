Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), has urged residents of Gombe state to consider the competence and capacity of candidates when voting. Obi said this on Wednesday during his party’s presidential campaign rally at the Pantami stadium in Gombe. He said voting for a candidate because of religion or tribe instead of competence and capacity won’t solve the country’s challenges. “Don’t vote for anybody because he is from the north. If they tell you they are from the north, tell them you are hungry, your children are hungry and have no jobs,” Obi said. “You have been voting for the north. What did you get from voting the north? Do you buy bread cheaper because you are from the north? Let nobody tell you about religion. Whoever does that, ask him to show you where Muslims or Christians buy bread cheaper. “Do Christians or Muslims buy bread cheaper because of their religion? That is why we are here to build a new Nigeria, where you all will be proud of; a Nigeria where children are in school. “Some will tell you it is their turn. It is nobody’s turn; it is your turn as Nigerians to take back your country.” In his remarks, Datti Baba-Ahmed, Obi’s running mate, said his party will not disappoint Nigerians if elected. “I am assuring you that Obi will not disappoint if he is elected president. He is tested and trusted. He has integrity and whatever he says, he will do, and that is why I am with him,” he said. “Obi will not steal the money that belongs to the poor. He is here to rescue Nigeria from its challenges. So, trust us with your votes and we will deliver good governance to you.”
