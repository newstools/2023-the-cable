The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), says the delay experienced by passengers along the Abuja-Kaduna train route on Monday was caused by the poor quality of diesel it received. Pascal Nnorli, manager, Abuja-Kaduna train service (AKTS), disclosed this while apologising to travellers in a statement. Train services resumed on the route just last month after an eight-month suspension due to a terrorist attack, which claimed the lives of many and led to the abduction of several passengers. The government had promised to improve its service delivery upon resumption. Speaking on the latest development in Abuja, Nnorli said the delay was due to a shortage in the supply of diesel. He also apologised to passengers for the corporation’s retarded services along the Abuja-Kaduna route on Monday. “The management of the NRC sincerely apologises to our esteemed customers who may have experienced delay in our Abuja-Kaduna train service on Monday, Jan. 23,” the manager said. “The delay was caused by the supply of diesel/AGO, which fell short of the specification required to operate our rolling stock, which was outrightly rejected after statutory laboratory test. “The compulsory laboratory test is carried out on all liquid that is used on the rolling stock, locomotives inclusive to ensure that the right specifications are utilised.’’ Nnorli, however, thanked passengers for the “continued patronage” and pledged the commitment of the corporation for better services going forward.
