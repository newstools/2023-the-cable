Peter Obi, standard bearer of the Labour Party (LP), has advised traditional rulers in Anambra state to get involved in the 2023 general election. Obi said this on Tuesday during a meeting with traditional rulers in Awka, the Anambra capital. The former Anambra governor blamed the challenges the country is facing on inflation, unemployment, and insecurity, adding that there is a need for the country to take advantage of its agricultural potential to tackle unemployment. “Sitting on the fence during the 2023 elections might be costly for the country politically,” NAN quoted Obi as saying. “I know that the constitution requires that the traditional rulers should not play partisan politics, but when bad leaders are elected, it affects you adversely like others. “For this, you must get involved in a manner that you would not be seen, but your actions felt.” According to NAN, Sunday Okafor, the traditional ruler of Okpuno community, Awka north LGA of Anambra, said the traditional rulers  are happy with the wave being made by Obi. “We are happy that your candidacy today is trailed by news of your competency, capability, and capacity to man the presidency of Nigeria,” Okafor said. “The news around your aspiration is that you represent hope for a new Nigeria and not that you came from the south-east and we are happy for that.”
