Bola Tinubu, standard bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has asked Nigerians relocating abroad to have a rethink, saying, ‘hope and success’ are here. Speaking at a campaign rally in Enugu on Wednesday, Tinubu said those running abroad are ‘suffering’, noting that he had been oversea before and saw it all. “People running away to Canada and Britain… suffer suffer. We have been there, we have seen them all. God bless Nigeria,” he said. The former governor of Lagos said citizens should be ready to make sacrifices for the good of the country. “I’m pragmatic, a thinker, a doer, a blessed man, a brilliant man. The hope is here. The success is here,” he said. Tinubu said the governments of the south-east should be ready to partner with the federal government to turn the geo-political zone into an industrial hub – a goal he said he is ready to pursue if elected president. “If the federal government collaborates with you if you elect me as the president – [there will] be an industrial hub for Enugu,” he said. “For Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra, Abia – deep sea ports and fabricating engines. Enugu will become an industrial hub, greater than before. There will be jobs for all of you. You have incredible mineral resources to propel economic recovery. “You are also an agricultural powerhouse that can produce many cash crops.” He called on Nigerians to get their permanent voters’ cards (PVCs), because it is a “liberation card”. “Go and pick your PVC, no matter how much they try to frustrate you,” he said. “Don’t be frustrated. That PVC is a liberation card, a success card, it is a gold mine. Don’t kid with it.”
