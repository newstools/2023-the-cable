Four police officers have been reportedly killed during an attack on the convoy of Ikedi Ohakim, a former governor of Imo state. The incident was said to have happened on Monday evening at Oriagu in Ehime Mbano LGA of Imo state. According to Punch, the former Imo governor escaped death by the whiskers as the gunmen bombed the backup vehicle in his convoy. The former governor was said to have been returning from a visit alongside his two children when the incident happened. A source close to the governor reportedly said it took the bravery of the driver for Ohakim and his children to escape. “His excellency was the main target but his driver was smart enough to beat them because they were driving to block him,” the source said. “Disappointed that their main target had escaped, they blocked his backup vehicle and burnt it. The four policemen with him were burnt.” This is not the first time a politician will be attacked in Imo state. On May 30, 2021, Ahmed Gulak, a former political adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, was killed in Owerri, the Imo capital, while on his way to the airport. On December 16, 2022, gunmen killed Christopher Eleghu, the candidate of the Labour Party (LP) for Onuimo constituency in the Imo state house of assembly. Eleghu was reportedly killed in his country home.
