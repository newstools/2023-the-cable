Guinea Bissau and Colombia became the latest countries to name stadiums after Pele, the Brazilian football legend who recently died. Pele, born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, passed away last week after battling colon cancer. To honour his legend, Gianino Infantino, FIFA president, appealed to all member nations to name a stadium after the three-time World Cup winner. Cape Verde became the first nation to announce plans to rename a stadium after Pele. They have now been joined by both Guinea Bissau and Colombia. In a statement, the government of Guinea Bissau announced that the stadium in the town of Bafatá is to be named after Pelé. The government said the decision was taken by the Guinean head of state and the council of ministers in recognition of Pele as the “king of world football”. “As a result and as an expression of public recognition of the status of King of World Football that is granted to him [Pele], the Council of Ministers decided to name the Regional State of Bafatá ‘Pele Stadium’ in response to the appeal of the president of FIFA”, the statement reads. In a similar move to honour Pele, Juan Guillermo Zuluaga, governor of Colombia’s southern meta department, announced that the 15,000-capacity Villavicencio stadium will bear Pele’s name. “From the Colombian plains, we announce to the world that our wonderful stadium in Villavicencio will be called Bello Horizonte “Rey Pelé”,” he said in a statement. “The future generations should know who this icon of world football was. We have accepted FIFA’s suggestion.” Pele was laid to rest on Tuesday following a private funeral at the Necropole Ecumenica Memorial Cemetery in the city of Santos, Brazil. Before his final internment, a 24-hour wake was held in honour of the late football legend. Mourners lined the streets as Pele’s body was transported in a black coffin around the city before moving him to his final resting place.
