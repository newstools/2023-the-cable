The Kaduna government says troops of operation Forest Sanity have killed two suspected bandits in Chikun LGA of the state. Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, announced the development in a statement on Tuesday. He said other suspected bandits escaped with bullet wounds during patrol along the Kaboresha-Rijana-forest in Kuzo-Kujeni-Gwanto-Kachia axis. “Troops of Operation Forest Sanity have neutralised two bandits and cleared several hideouts in Chikun LGA,” the statement reads. “According to operational feedback to the Kaduna State Government, the troops achieved these breakthroughs during fighting patrols along the Kaboresha-Rijana Forest-Kuzo-Kujeni-Gwanto-Kachia axis. “The troops set up an ambush position along the Gwanto-Kwasau Road, and thus engaged bandits approaching the location on motorcycles. The troops neutralised two bandits and recovered three motorcycles. “The troops also raided bandits camps in the Kutura-Rijana general area. The bandits fled into the forest on sighting the troops, who then destroyed the camps and recovered three motorcycles. “Other items recovered include several sets of military uniforms and bandoliers. “The onslaught against bandits is in progress and government appeals to the general public to continue to volunteer useful information. “Receiving the report, Governor Nasir El-Rufai expressed satisfaction and commended the troops for their committed efforts which resulted in the latest success.” The development comes days after troops of operation Forest Sanity killed four suspected bandits in the state.
