Supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun, on Friday, took to major streets to express their dissatisfaction over the verdict of the governorship election petition tribunal. The protesters were seen carrying placards with different inscriptions and chanting. Some of the inscriptions on the placards read: ‘We say no to APC in Osun’, ‘Tribunal panel is not fair’, ‘Don’t dash our people’s mandate’, and ‘Olorunda local government says no to tribunal judgment’. Roads leading to the Olaiya junction and old garage area were blocked. Protesters interviewed by NAN said the judgment was a repetition of what transpired in the state during the 2018 governorship election. TheCable had reported that the Osun governorship election petition tribunal, on Friday, sacked Ademola Adeleke as the governor of the state. In August 2022, Gboyega Oyetola and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), petitioned the tribunal to challenge the election victory of Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Among several issues, Oyetola said there was overvoting in 749 polling units across 10 LGAs of the state. Oyetola also challenged Adeleke’s eligibility to contest the election. Delivering judgment on Friday, two out of a three-member panel of the tribunal held that the petitioner was able to prove that there was over-voting in some of the polling units.
