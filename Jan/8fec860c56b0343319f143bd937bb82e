The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) has debunked claims that it registered one “wickedness association of Nigeria, Lokoja chapter” as a business name. The commission said this in a statement on Monday. According to the statement, a certificate going viral on social media had claimed that the commission registered a group called the ‘Wickedness Association of Nigeria, Lokoja chapter’ as a business name on December 24, 2022. But CAC refuted the allegations, saying it did not register “any association” of such. It also said the purported registration, which was signed by a retired officer in the commission, is an act of forgery and fraud. “Our attention has been drawn to a certificate of registration making the rounds in the social media and claiming that the commission registered the Wickedness Association of Nigeria Lokoja Chapter,” the notice reads. “The certificate claimed that the ‘association’ was registered as a business name on December 24, 2022, with the registration number BN 74101. “We wish to categorically state that the purported certificate of registration of ‘wickedness association of Nigeria Lokoja branch’ was not and could not have been issued by the commission for the following reasons: “The commission does not register associations as business names. “The name and object of the ‘association’ offend the provisions of section 852 (1)(c) in that they are undesirable, offensive and contrary to public policy. “The officer who purportedly signed the certificate had retired from the service of the commission long before the date the certificate was purportedly issued. “Accordingly, the general public is hereby informed that the purported certificate of registration of ‘wickedness association of Nigeria Lokoja branch’ is false, fake and a forgery. It is wicked and fraudulent!” CAC, therefore, urged the public to always cross-check the registration of entities by the commission on search.cac.gov.ng at no cost.”
