Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has returned to Nigeria after spending days in the United Kingdom. Paul Ibe, Abubakar’s media adviser, confirmed his arrival to TheCable on Friday morning. Ibe said Abubakar returned on Thursday night. TheCable had reported how the party’s candidate travelled to London where he met with officials of the UK government. Abubakar attended the meeting alongside Bukola Saraki, former senate president; Aminu Tambuwal, Sokoto governor, and Udom Emmanuel, governor of Akwa Ibom, among others. While abroad, there were speculations that Abubakar was in the country to seek medical attention but the PDP presidential campaign council debunked the reports. The campaign council said the former vice-president was in the UK at the invitation of the British government. See photos of his arrival below:
