Jumia, a pan-African e-commerce platform, says the old naira notes will no longer be accepted as payment at the point of delivery from January 30. The e-commerce giant said this in a notice to customers on its mobile application, adding that the decision was based on the recent currency redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The notice also comes three days ahead of the January 31 deadline for the validity of the old N200, N500 and N1000 notes in circulation. In October last year, the CBN announced the naira redesign policy which entails the issuance of new higher denomination naira notes to replace the existing ones. The apex bank had also insisted that the deadline would not be changed despite the continued hankering for an extension by some critics. Jumia, in its notice, said that only the new notes would be collected from January 30, 2023, or payments could be made through other means. “From Monday 30th January 2023, Jumia delivery associates will not be able to accept the old notes of N200, N500, and N1,000 sequel to the directive by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN),” the statement reads. “Should you wish to pay by cash, our delivery associates will only accept the new series of notes.
