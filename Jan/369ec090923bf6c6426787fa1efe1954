Gunmen have reportedly killed a couple who were travelling home for their traditional wedding in Imo. The couple, identified as Ezemezie Ifechukwu Martins and Mba Ifeoma Gloria, were said to have been killed on Tuesday night at Ndiejezie Izuogu in Ideato north LGA of the state. According to a source in the area, the couple was killed “days before their wedding”. The younger brother to the groom was also reportedly murdered during the attack. The source who spoke with TheCable said attackers are notorious for snatching cars in the area, adding that vehicle owners who refuse to surrender to them are killed in the process. “We are no longer safe in Arondizogu. Students are afraid of going to school. Our mothers are no longer going to the market for fear of the unknown,” the source added. “As we speak, there is mass exodus of people from Arondizogu this morning after the incident last night. “I complained of these reckless kidnappings and killings and burning of vehicles in Arondizogu last year, and the Imo state PPRO assured me that something was already done about it. “But since then, the killing and kidnapping have been everyday affair. “Our people living abroad did not come back for Christmas and New Year celebrations. The few that came back could not move around in their cars. It’s an unfortunate situation. “We call on the government of Imo state to come to our rescue and send the military to take over the area to forestall further killings.” Meanwhile, efforts to reach Michael Abattam, police spokesperson in the state, on the incident were not successful.
