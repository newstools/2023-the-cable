President Muhammadu Buhari is billed to lead the campaign of Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Bauchi state on Monday. In a statement on Sunday, Bayo Onanuga, director of media of the APC presidential campaign council, said the rally is billed for 8:30 am on Monday morning because the president has to be in Lagos for a two-day working visit.
