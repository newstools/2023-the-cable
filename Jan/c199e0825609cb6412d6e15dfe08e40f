A school and a worship centre were destroyed after dynamite exploded in Azare, Katagum LGA of Bauchi. NAN reported that Aminu Alhassan, commissioner of police in the state, confirmed the development when Bala Mohammed, Bauchi governor, visited Umar Farouk II, emir of Katagum, to commiserate with him over the incident. Alhassan said the incident occurred on January 22. Explaining that the incident was not linked to an attack by insurgents, the police commissioner said it was caused by dynamite kept in an old construction company for more than 30 years in the area. Residents of the area were said to have cleared the bushes around the construction company, after which fire was set to the refuse gathered from the site. Alhassan added that there was no casualty from the explosion, but a school and a worship centre in the area were affected. The police commissioner urged residents of the state to remain calm as the situation was under control. In his remarks, Bala Mohammed, governor of the state, said efforts are ongoing to ensure that developmental projects reach those who are outside the Bauchi capital. “We, as a government, promise to provide more support to the security agencies in the state, to enable them to perform their duties effectively,” he added.
