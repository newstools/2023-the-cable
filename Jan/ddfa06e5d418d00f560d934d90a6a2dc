Abdulmumin Jibrin, spokesperson of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) campaign, says the All Progressives Congress (APC) will struggle in the north in the forthcoming elections. Jibrin spoke on Monday during an interview with Channels Television. He said momentum has now shifted to Rabiu Kwankwaso, presidential candidate of the NNPP, adding that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the APC are in a damaging and challenging situation. The NNPP campaign spokesperson said Kwankwaso will get all the votes in Kano and win the state with a landslide victory, adding that no candidate can get up to 25 percent votes in the state. “When APC do their analysis, all the time they talk about PDP and they say PDP lost Kwankwaso, PDP lost Peter Obi, PDP lost five governors,” Jibrin said. “Yes PDP is in crisis, not only crisis PDP is in a mess but APC is even in a more damaging and more challenging situation, those 12 million votes are not there. “When you say Kwankwaso left PDP, the assumption is that he left with only PDP people but many people from APC joined him. Where did I come from? Am I not coming from APC? As it stands today, APC has lost about 70 to 80 percent of its support base in Northern Nigeria. “When Kwankwaso mops up the votes, particularly from the north-west in addition to those he will get in the south where he is making inroads, the party will win the election.” Until May 2022, Jibrin, a former Kano lawmaker, was an APC member and the director-general of the Bola Tinubu support group council. TheCable understands that Jibrin decided to leave the party after another face-off with Abdullahi Ganduje, the governor of Kano state. Jibrin had wanted to contest for a seat in the house of reps on the party’s platform but was reportedly blocked by Ganduje with whom he had been having a running battle for five years.
