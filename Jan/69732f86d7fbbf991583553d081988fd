Troops of operation Hadin Kai have reportedly killed 32 insurgents, including one Abu Illiya, identified as a top Boko Haram commander, in Borno. According to Zagazola Makama, a publication focused on the Lake Chad region, the insurgents were killed in an operation in Konduga LGA in the state. The publication said the troops encountered the insurgents during a counter-offensive patrol in Yuwe. “It was gathered that the troops achieved the feats during intelligence-led aggressive fighting patrols in some identified Boko Haram hideouts in Kayamari, Habasha, and Yuwe villages,” the publication reports. “An intelligence source told Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency expert and security analyst in Lake Chad, that the troops made contact with the terrorists in the course of the counter-offensive patrol in Yuwe which led to a heavy gun battle. “The sources said that the troops successfully defeated Boko Haram terrorists while others reportedly fled in disarray due to the superior firepower from the soldiers thus abandoning their properties and weapons. “The troops also destroyed 50 bicycles recovered in the hideouts of the terrorists.” Nigerian troops, in recent times, have sustained efforts on decimating insurgent groups.
