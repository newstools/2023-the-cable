Titi, wife of Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says her husband will lead Nigeria to “greater heights” if elected. Titi said her husband has a “covenant” to do “so much” for Nigeria because of what he has benefited from the country. The wife of the PDP presidential candidate spoke on Sunday at a town hall meeting in Lagos. She told Nigerians not to be deceived because only her husband can “lead the way”. “My husband, Atiku Abubakar has a covenant with Nigerians,” she said. “He promised his life to do so much for Nigeria because Nigeria has done so much for him. “Because of this, he has five-point agenda. He is a unifier, he wants to unify Nigeria. Atiku wants insecurity in Nigeria to stop and Atiku wants to restructure Nigeria. Atiku matches his words with authority. “Atiku wants to rescue, restore, restructure, rebuild and take Nigeria’s glory to greater heights.” “He has done it before and he will do it again. It is only the person that knows the road that can show the way. Don’t allow a blind man to lead you. “So, I am pleading with you, do not sell your birthrights and the generation yet unborn. Vote for the PDP on February 25 and March 11. “My husband, Atiku Abubakar is a good product to sell. if not, I won’t be bold to come here to sell him. Only Atiku can do it. Do not be deceived. “If you vote Atiku, you have voted for me,  your daughter and I will not forget you.” Titi said Abubakar has the experience to be president having been vice president for eight years. She noted that her husband would create an enabling environment for women and youth to excel and would prioritise health, education, and security, and will fix the economy.
